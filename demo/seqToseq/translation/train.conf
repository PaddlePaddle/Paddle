### Data Definiation
data_dir  = "./data/pre-wmt14"
train_conf = seq_to_seq_data(data_dir = data_dir, 
                             is_generating = is_generating)

### Algorithm Configuration
settings(
    learning_method = AdamOptimizer(),
    batch_size = 50,
    learning_rate = 5e-4)

### Network Architecture
