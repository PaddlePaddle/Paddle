#  This can be set independent of any concrete spawner implementation.
#c.Spawner.post_stop_hook = None

## An optional hook function that you can implement to do some bootstrapping work
#  before the spawner starts. For example, create a directory for your user or
#  load initial content.
#  
#  This can be set independent of any concrete spawner implementation.
#  
#  Example::
#  
#      from subprocess import check_call
#      def my_hook(spawner):
#          username = spawner.user.name
#          check_call(['./examples/bootstrap-script/bootstrap.sh', username])
#  
#      c.Spawner.pre_spawn_hook = my_hook
#c.Spawner.pre_spawn_hook = None

## Timeout (in seconds) before giving up on starting of single-user server.
#  
#  This is the timeout for start to return, not the timeout for the server to
#  respond. Callers of spawner.start will assume that startup has failed if it
#  takes longer than this. start should return when the server process is started
#  and its location is known.
#c.Spawner.start_timeout = 60

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LocalProcessSpawner(Spawner) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Spawner that uses `subprocess.Popen` to start single-user servers as local
#  processes.
#  
#  Requires local UNIX users matching the authenticated users to exist. Does not
#  work on Windows.
#  
#  This is the default spawner for JupyterHub.
#  
#  Note: This spawner does not implement CPU / memory guarantees and limits.

## Seconds to wait for single-user server process to halt after SIGINT.
#  
#  If the process has not exited cleanly after this many seconds, a SIGTERM is
#  sent.
#c.LocalProcessSpawner.interrupt_timeout = 10

## Seconds to wait for process to halt after SIGKILL before giving up.
#  
#  If the process does not exit cleanly after this many seconds of SIGKILL, it
#  becomes a zombie process. The hub process will log a warning and then give up.
#c.LocalProcessSpawner.kill_timeout = 5

## Extra keyword arguments to pass to Popen
#  
#  when spawning single-user servers.
#  
#  For example::
#  
#      popen_kwargs = dict(shell=True)
#c.LocalProcessSpawner.popen_kwargs = {}

## Specify a shell command to launch.
#  
#  The single-user command will be appended to this list, so it sould end with
#  `-c` (for bash) or equivalent.
#  
#  For example::
#  
#      c.LocalProcessSpawner.shell_cmd = ['bash', '-l', '-c']
#  
#  to launch with a bash login shell, which would set up the user's own complete
#  environment.
#  
#  .. warning::
#  
#      Using shell_cmd gives users control over PATH, etc.,
#      which could change what the jupyterhub-singleuser launch command does.
#      Only use this for trusted users.
#c.LocalProcessSpawner.shell_cmd = []

## Seconds to wait for single-user server process to halt after SIGTERM.
#  
#  If the process does not exit cleanly after this many seconds of SIGTERM, a
#  SIGKILL is sent.
#c.LocalProcessSpawner.term_timeout = 5

# Authenticator(LoggingConfigurable) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Base class for implementing an authentication provider for JupyterHub

## Set of users that will have admin rights on this JupyterHub.
#  
#  Admin users have extra privileges:
#   - Use the admin panel to see list of users logged in
#   - Add / remove users in some authenticators
#   - Restart / halt the hub
#   - Start / stop users' single-user servers
#   - Can access each individual users' single-user server (if configured)
#  
#  Admin access should be treated the same way root access is.
#  
#  Defaults to an empty set, in which case no user has admin access.
c.Authenticator.admin_users = set(("jovyan", "paddle"))

## Automatically begin the login process
#  
#  rather than starting with a "Login with..." link at `/hub/login`
#  
#  To work, `.login_url()` must give a URL other than the default `/hub/login`,
#  such as an oauth handler or another automatic login handler, registered with
#  `.get_handlers()`.
#  
#  .. versionadded:: 0.8
#c.Authenticator.auto_login = False

## Blacklist of usernames that are not allowed to log in.
#  
#  Use this with supported authenticators to restrict which users can not log in.
#  This is an additional blacklist that further restricts users, beyond whatever
#  restrictions the authenticator has in place.
#  
#  If empty, does not perform any additional restriction.
#  
#  .. versionadded: 0.9
#c.Authenticator.blacklist = set()

## Enable persisting auth_state (if available).
#  
#  auth_state will be encrypted and stored in the Hub's database. This can
#  include things like authentication tokens, etc. to be passed to Spawners as
#  environment variables.
#  
#  Encrypting auth_state requires the cryptography package.
#  
#  Additionally, the JUPYTERHUB_CRYPT_KEY environment variable must contain one
#  (or more, separated by ;) 32B encryption keys. These can be either base64 or
#  hex-encoded.
#  
#  If encryption is unavailable, auth_state cannot be persisted.
#  
#  New in JupyterHub 0.8
#c.Authenticator.enable_auth_state = False

## Dictionary mapping authenticator usernames to JupyterHub users.
#  
#  Primarily used to normalize OAuth user names to local users.

#  not be attempted.

#  If not set, allow any username.

## Whitelist of usernames that are allowed to log in.
#  
#  Use this with supported authenticators to restrict which users can log in.

#  If empty, does not perform any additional restriction.

# LocalAuthenticator(Authenticator) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Base class for Authenticators that work with local Linux/UNIX users
#  
#  Checks for local users, and can attempt to create them if they exist.

## The command to use for creating users as a list of strings
#  
#  For each element in the list, the string USERNAME will be replaced with the
#  user's username. The username will also be appended as the final argument.
#  
#  For Linux, the default value is:
#  
#      ['adduser', '-q', '--gecos', '""', '--disabled-password']
#  
#  To specify a custom home directory, set this to:
#  
#      ['adduser', '-q', '--gecos', '""', '--home', '/customhome/USERNAME', '--
#  disabled-password']
#  
#  This will run the command:
#  
#      adduser -q --gecos "" --home /customhome/river --disabled-password river
#  
#  when the user 'river' is created.
c.LocalAuthenticator.add_user_cmd = [
    'adduser', '-q', '--gecos', '""', '--home', '/home/USERNAME',
    '--disabled-password'

## If set to True, will attempt to create local system users if they do not exist
#  already.
#  
#  Supports Linux and BSD variants only.

# PAMAuthenticator(LocalAuthenticator) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authenticate local UNIX users with PAM

## Whether to check the user's account status via PAM during authentication.
#  
#  The PAM account stack performs non-authentication based account  management.
#  It is typically used to restrict/permit access to a  service and this step is
#  needed to access the host's user access control.
#  
#  Disabling this can be dangerous as authenticated but unauthorized users may be
#  granted access and, therefore, arbitrary execution on the system.
#c.PAMAuthenticator.check_account = True

## The text encoding to use when communicating with PAM
#c.PAMAuthenticator.encoding = 'utf8'

## Whether to open a new PAM session when spawners are started.
#  
#  This may trigger things like mounting shared filsystems, loading credentials,
#  etc. depending on system configuration, but it does not always work.
#  
#  If any errors are encountered when opening/closing PAM sessions, this is
#  automatically set to False.
#c.PAMAuthenticator.open_sessions = True

## The name of the PAM service to use for authentication
#c.PAMAuthenticator.service = 'login'
