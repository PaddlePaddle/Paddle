# To release PaddlePaddle as a pip package, we have to follow the
# manylinux1 standard, which features as old Linux kernels and
# compilers as possible and recommends CentOS 5. Indeed, the earliest
# CentOS version that works with NVIDIA CUDA is CentOS 6.  And a new
# version of boost, say, 1.66.0, doesn't build on CentOS 6.  We
# checked that the devtools package of CentOS 6 installs boost 1.41.0.
# So we use 1.41.0 here.
