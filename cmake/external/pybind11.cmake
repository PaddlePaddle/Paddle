  # Paddle's CI uses cache to accelarate the make process. However, error might raise when patch codes in two scenarios:
  # 1. Patch to the wrong version: the tag version of CI's cache falls behind PYBIND_TAG, use `git checkout ${PYBIND_TAG}` to solve this.
  # 2. Patch twice: the tag version of cache == PYBIND_TAG, but patch has already applied to cache.
