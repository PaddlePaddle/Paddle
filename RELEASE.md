# Release v0.10.0

We are glad to release version 0.10.0.  In this version, we are happy to
release the
new
[Python API](http://research.baidu.com/paddlepaddles-new-api-simplifies-deep-learning-programs/).

- Our old Python API is kind of out of date.  It's hard to learn and hard to
  use.  To write a PaddlePaddle program using the old API, we'd have to write
  at least two Python files: one `data provider` and another one that defines
  the network topology.  Users start a PaddlePaddle job by running the
  `paddle_trainer` C++ program, which calls Python interpreter to run the
  network topology configuration script and then start the training loop,
  which iteratively calls the data provider function to load minibatches.
  This prevents us from writing a Python program in a modern way, e.g., in the
  Jupyter Notebook.
  
- The new API, which we often refer to as the *v2 API*, allows us to write
  much shorter Python programs to define the network and the data in a single
  .py file.  Also, this program can run in Jupyter Notebook, since the entry
  point is in Python program and PaddlePaddle runs as a shared library loaded
  and invoked by this Python program.
  
Basing on the new API, we delivered an online interative
book, [Deep Learning 101](http://book.paddlepaddle.org/index.en.html)
and [its Chinese version](http://book.paddlepaddle.org/).

We also worked on updating our online documentation to describe the new API.
But this is an ongoing work.  We will release more documentation improvements
in the next version.

We also worked on bring the new API to distributed model training (via MPI and
Kubernetes).  This work is ongoing. We will release more about it in the next
version.
