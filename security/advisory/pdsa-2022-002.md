## PDSA-2022-002: Code injection in paddle.audio.functional.get_window

### Impact

`paddle.audio.functional.get_windowis` vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied `winstr`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution.

```python
def get_window(
    window: Union[str, Tuple[str, float]],
    win_length: int,
    fftbins: bool = True,
    dtype: str = 'float64',
) -> Tensor:
    ...
    try:
        winfunc = eval('_' + winstr)
    except NameError as e:
        raise ValueError("Unknown window type.") from e
```

### Patches

We have patched the issue in commit [26c419ca386aeae3c461faf2b828d00b48e908eb](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/26c419ca386aeae3c461faf2b828d00b48e908eb).

The fix will be included in PaddlePaddle 2.4.
