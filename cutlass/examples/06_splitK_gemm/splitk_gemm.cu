/**
This example shows how to use split-k version of matrix multiplication using functions and data
structures provided by CUTLASS; which we run on a NVIDIA Volta GPU.

What is split-k?
Consider a problem size of M = 128, N = 128, K = 4096. In this case, if my thread-block tile size (a
tile can be viewed as a 2d matrix) is 128x128x4096, then we launch a singled a thread-block taking
up a single SM of 84 SMs present on V100. Hence the efficiency of computation is really low. So, how
to solve it? This is where split-k comes in. It is a way of partitioning K-dimension of matrix
multiplication and distribute across multiple SMs and get better efficiency than single SM. In the
above example, we can partition K-dimension with split-k factor of 16 i.e., thread-block tile size
will be 128x128x256 and will be launching on 16 SMs. Once each thread-block computes their partial
inner product (1/16th of output), they accumulate to single output matrix.

Writing a single high performance matrix multiplication kernel is hard but do-able. Whereas writing
high performance kernels at scale which works for multiple problem sizes with good abstractions is
really hard. CUTLASS solves this problem by providing simplified abstractions to compose
multiple sections of gemm kernel. When used properly, the kernels can hit peak performance of GPU
easily.

CUTLASS divides a kernel into hierarchical composable sections. Which means, at each thread, warp
and thread-block level, they compute on their own tile-size with higher level of tile sizes being
composed from lower level ones. Multiple thread-tiles (tile size each thread computes) can be used
to form warp-tiles (tile size each warp computes) and multiple warp tiles can be used to compute
threadblock-tile (tile size computed by a threadblock).

In thie example, we split variable initialization into
1. Setting up data properties : describes how matrices are laid out in the memory and how the kernel
can view them (logical to physical mapping)
2. Setting up computation properties : describes how the above set matrices will be used to compute
output of matrix multiplication.

First, we setup the data types of matrices A, B, C and D along with alpha, beta as the equation for
GEMM is D = alpha * A * B + beta * C. In CUTLASS, the kernels first compute A * B and leaves the
rest of the computation to end of the kernel as alpha * X + beta * C is a simple element-wise
operation on X (A * B) and C. We call this as epilogue of kernel. Hence, we setup data types for
alpha and beta to be equal to ElementComputeEpilogue = float. As we want to MMA instructions on
Volta and they support only half-precision floating point (fp16 or half), we use data type for
elements in input matrix A and B as cutlass::half_t. Volta also supports accumulation of partial dot
product to fp32, which can store wider range of numbers, we use it as data type of output matrix
elements and accumulation. We convey this to CUTLASS kernel by initializing template variables
ElementAccumulator (float), ElementComputeEpilogue (float), ElementInputA (cutlass::half_t),
ElementInputB (cutlass::half_t), ElementOutput (float). Communicating just the data type is not
enough. As the data is laid out linearly in memory, we have to convey the layout of matrices. We do
that by initializing template variable LayoutInputA to column major cutlass variable, LayoutInputB
to row major and LayoutOutput to row major. Next, we setup rules to comptue alpha * X + beta * C
which is called epilogue of the kernel. We initialize template variable EpilogueOp, which takes the
data type of output ElementOutput (int32_t), the number of elements per vector memory access (16),
data type of accumulator (int32_t) and data type of computation of linear combination (alpha * X +
beta * C).

Now that we setup the properties of data, we have to setup properties of computation.

Second, we create template variables of tile sizes for thread-block, warp and mma-op to 128x128x32,
64x64x4, 8x8x4 (MxNxK) respectively. When passed to instantiate CUTLASS GEMM kernel, it internally
deduce the amount of threads needed per thread-block, amount of shared memory, storing data in
bank-conflict free manner, and ton of other variables required to compose, intialize and launch a
high performance GEMM kernel. This is the beauty of CUTLASS, it relieves developer from
understanding and coding complicated hardware optimizations which can easily go wrong.

There are few more template variables initialized such as, which threadblock tile of output matrix
is done which threadblock launched on an SM, CUDA SM architecture of GPU you want to run on.

These are all put together to create a template variable which describes CUTLASS GEMM kernel using
cutlass::gemm::device::GemmSplitKParallel template.

The next step is to intialize physical data, instantiate and initialize CUTLASS kernel and run it.
We use CUTLASS utilities to initialize, fill, compare matrices as they are simple and doesn't come
in the way of learning CUTLASS.

Once all the matrices are initialized and filled with data, create arguments tuple to launch CUTLASS
kernel which takes problem size (M = 5120, N = 4096 and K = 4096), matrices, alpha, beta and the
important one, split k-dimension factor. Along with that, we query CUTLASS if any scratch-space
memory required by the kernel we instantiated. If yes, we create it and pass it along with other
arguments created to intialize CUTLASS kernel then, the kernel is launched.

In this example, we later on launch a reference gemm kernel (from CUTLASS utilities) to compare if
the output from CUTLASS kernel is same as reference GEMM kernel.
