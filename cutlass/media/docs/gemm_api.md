# CUTLASS GEMM API

CUTLASS presents a uniform programming model for matrix multiply-accumulate operations at each level of the hierarchy. This document
focuses on device-level, threadblock-level GEMMs, warp-level GEMMs, thread-level GEMMs, and instruction-level GEMMs.

# CUTLASS GEMM Model

CUTLASS implements the basic GEMM triple loop nest with a tiled structure mirroring the execution model hierarchy.

The following pseudocode describes the model for a GEMM kernel targeting a warp-synchronous matrix multiply instruction like
mma.sync. The entire operation is referred to as "Gemm," as it is assumed that an epilogue operation performs the general matrix
update similar to BLAS.

```c++
                                                                            // cutlass::gemm::device::Gemm
                                                                            //
for (int cta_n = 0; cta_n < GemmN; cta_n += CtaTileN) {                     // for each CTA       } CTA-level concurrency
  for (int cta_m = 0; cta_m < GemmM; cta_m += CtaTileM) {                   //    for each CTA    }
                                                                            //    
                                                                            // cutlass::gemm::threadblock::Mma
                                                                            //
    for (int cta_k = 0; cta_k < GemmK; cta_k += CtaTileK) {                 //       "GEMM mainloop" - no unrolling - one iteration of this loop is one "stage"
                                                                            //
      for (int warp_n = 0; warp_n < CtaTileN; warp_n += WarpTileN) {        // for each warp      } warp-level concurrency
        for (int warp_m = 0; warp_m < CtaTileM; warp_m += WarpTileM) {      //    for each warp   }
                                                                            //
          for (int warp_k = 0; warp_k < CtaTileK; warp_k += MmaK) {         //       fully unroll across CtaTileK - one iteration of this loop is one "k Group" == "MmaK"
                                                                            //
            for (int mma_k = 0; mma_k < WarpTileK; mma_k += MmaK) {         // cutlass::gemm::warp::Mma
              for (int mma_n = 0; mma_n < WarpTileN; mma_n += MmaN) {       //
                for (int mma_m = 0; mma_m < WarpTileM; mma_m += MmaM) {     //
                                                                            //
                  mma_instruction(d, a, b, c);                              // cutlass::arch::mma - warp-wide matrix multiply instruction

                }   // for mma_m
              }   // for mma_n
            }   // for mma_k

          }   // for warp_k
        }   // for warp_m
      }   // for warp_n

    }   // for cta_k
  }   // for cta_m
}   // for cta_n

```

The outer-most loops correspond to CTA-level hardware concurrency and are not explicitly written as loops in the code. These
are implied by CUDA grid launch semantics.

The comment `cutlass::gemm::threadblock::Mma` refers to the threadblock-scoped matrix multiply-accumulate concept. This is
the computation performed by one threadblock to compute a matrix product in registers. The "GEMM main loop" is listed.

The comment `cutlass::gemm::warp::Mma` refers to the computation performed by each warp. This is a nested loop executing a
sequence of accumulated outer products. 

The inner-most operation corresponds directly to hardware support. In this example, the nested structure terminates with
warp-synchronous matrix multiply instructions targeting Tensor Cores. 
Alternatively, GEMMs targeting single-thread instructions may have an additional series of nested loops corresponding to 
thread-level concurrency.

# CUTLASS GEMM Components

This loop nest is expressed in CUTLASS via the following components which are specialized for data type, layout, and
math instruction.

![ALT](/media/images/cutlass-gemm-components.png "CUTLASS GEMM Components")

These components are described in the following sections.

## Device-wide GEMM API

The device-level GEMM API is intended to streamline instantiation and execution of the standard
GEMM computation across the GPU. This operator is intended to be used in host-side .cu code and
has semantics similar to cuBLAS.

The device-wide GEMM API is embodied by the following operators:
- [cutlass::gemm::device::Gemm](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm.h) - basic GEMM operation
- [cutlass::gemm::device::GemmArray](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm_array.h) - batched GEMM operation in which input matrices are read from arrays of pointers
- [cutlass::gemm::device::GemmBatched](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm_batched.h) - batched GEMM operation in which input matrices are separated by a constant stride
- [cutlass::gemm::device::GemmSplitKParallel](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm_splitk_parallel.h) - GEMM operation that partitions the GEMM K dimension then launches a separate reduction kernel

**Example:** launch a mixed-precision GEMM targeting Volta Tensor Cores.
```c++
  using Gemm = cutlass::gemm::device::Gemm<
    cutlass::half_t,                           // ElementA
    cutlass::layout::ColumnMajor,              // LayoutA
    cutlass::half_t,                           // ElementB
    cutlass::layout::ColumnMajor,              // LayoutB
    cutlass::half_t,                           // ElementOutput
    cutlass::layout::ColumnMajor,              // LayoutOutput
    float,                                     // ElementAccumulator
    cutlass::arch::OpClassTensorOp,            // tag indicating Tensor Cores
    cutlass::arch::Sm70                        // tag indicating target GPU compute architecture
  >;

  Gemm gemm_op;
  cutlass::Status status;
 
  //
  // Launch GEMM on the device
  //
 
  status = gemm_op({
    {m, n, k},
    {ptrA, lda},
    {ptrB, ldb},
    {ptrC, ldc},
    {ptrD, ldd},
    {alpha, beta}
  });

  if (status != cutlass::Status::kSuccess) {
    return -1;
  }
```


## Threadblock-level GEMM API

GEMMs at this scope are expected to efficiently load tiles of data from global memory into internal storage and then compute matrix
products with warp-level GEMM operators.

The threadblock-scoped matrix multiply operation is embodied by 
[cutlass::gemm::threadblock::MmaPipelined](/include/cutlass/gemm/threadblock/mma_pipelined.h).
This is a class inspired by [std::transform_reduce()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/transform_reduce) 
which computes the accumulated matrix product of a range of tiles defined by tile iterators.

![ALT](/media/images/cutlass-threadblock-mma-pipelined.png "cutlass::gemm::threadblock::MmaPipelined")

In the case of GEMM, the tile iterators are 
[cutlass::transform::threadblock::PredicatedTileIterator](/include/cutlass/transform/threadblock/predicated_tile_iterator.h)
to traverse a sequence of tiles in global memory with appropriate predication to avoid out-of-bounds
memory accesses.

*Concept.* Threadblock-level matrix multiply accumulate operators are function objects satisfying the following concept.
```c++
struct Mma {
  /// Shape of warp-level matrix operation (concept: GemmShape)
  struct Shape;

  /// Data type of multiplicand A (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementA;

  /// Layout of multiplicand A (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutA;

  /// Data type of multiplicand B (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementB;

  /// Layout of multiplicand B (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutB;

  /// Data type of accumulator matrix C (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementC;

  /// Layout of accumulator matrix C (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutC;

  /// Iterator of A operand in shared memory - satisfies: ReadableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept
  struct IteratorA;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorA (concept: Array<ElementA, ..>)
  struct FragmentA;

  /// Iterator of B operand in shared memory - satisfies: ReadableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept
  struct IteratorB;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorB (concept: Array<ElementB, ..>)
  struct FragmentB;

  /// Iterator of C operand in shared memory - 
  ///    satisfies: ReadableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept | WriteableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept
  struct IteratorC;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorC (concept: Array<ElementC, ..>)
  struct FragmentC;

  /// Warp-level matrix multiply operator (concept: satisfies gemm::warp::Mma)
  struct Operator;

  //
  // Method
  //

  /// Computes a matrix product accumulated in D
  CUTLASS_DEVICE
  void operator()(
    FragmentC &D, 
    IteratorA iter_A, 
    IteratorB iter_B, 
    FragmentC const &C);
};
```

## Warp-level Matrix Multiply API

Warp-level GEMM operators load tiles from shared memory into registers and then compute matrix multiplies using either 
Tensor Cores or CUDA Cores. The result is accumulated in a register tile. Iterators are defined for each
operand `A`, `B`, and `C`.

The warp-level GEMM API is a generalization of CUDA's WMMA API to achieve the following objectives:

- native matrix multiply sizes of Tensor Cores
- permuted shared memory layouts to ensure conflict-free accesses
- pointer initilization outside of the mainloop
- efficient traversal

Defining a warp-level matrix multiply in CUTLASS is similar to WMMA as shown below.

![ALT](/media/images/cutlass-warp-level-gemm-api-instantiation.png "CUTLASS vs WMMA API")

The usage model is also similar. The following example computes a warp-level GEMM operation,
accumulating a series of matrix products in a register-backed array. The input to a warp-level
GEMM operation in CUTLASS _must_ be data in shared memory loaded by iterators or on 
register-backed fragments.

![ALT](/media/images/cutlass-warp-level-gemm-operation.png "CUTLASS warp-level GEMM API")

```c++
#include "cutlass/gemm/warp/default_mma_tensor_op.h"

using LayoutA = cutlass::layout::ColumnMajorTensorOpMultiplicandCongruous<
    cutlass::sizeof_bits<Element>::value, 64>;

using LayoutB = cutlass::layout::RowMajorTensorOpMultiplicandCongruous<
    cutlass::sizeof_bits<Element>::value, 64>;

using WarpMma = typename cutlass::gemm::warp::DefaultMmaTensorOp<
    cutlass::gemm::GemmShape<64, 64, 8>,                            // Overall warp-level GEMM operation
    cutlass::gemm::GemmShape<16, 8, 8>,                             // Target instruction
    cutlass::half_t, LayoutA,                                       // operand A type and layout
    cutlass::half_t, LayoutB,                                       // operand B type and layout
    float,                                                          // accumulator type
    cutlass::layout::RowMajor>::Type;                               // accumulator layout

//
// Define a GEMM operation loading data from shared memory
//
int const kGemmK = 32;

__shared__ ElementA smem_buffer_A[WarpMma::Shape::kM * kGemmK];
__shared__ ElementB smem_buffer_B[WarpMma::Shape::kN * kGemmK];

//
// Construct iterators into SMEM tiles
//

// leading dimensions inferred from matrix problem size
int lda = WarpMma::Shape::kM;
int ldb = WarpMma::Shape::kN;

// iterators into shared memory
WarpMma::IteratorA warp_iterator_A({smem_buffer_A, lda});
WarpMma::IteratorB warp_iterator_B({smem_buffer_B, ldb});

// Fragments in registers storing the operands
FragmentA frag_A;
FragmentB frag_B;
FragmentC accum;

WarpMma mma;

accum.clear();

//
// Accumulated outer product
//

#pragma unroll 1
for (int k = 0; k < kGemmK; k += WarpMma::Shape::kK) {

  
  iter_A.load(frag_A);  // Load fragments from A and B matrices
  iter_B.load(frag_B);

  ++iter_A; ++iter_B;   // Advance along GEMM K to next tile in A
                        //   and B matrices

                        // Compute matrix product
  mma(accum, frag_A, frag_B, accum);
}
```

*Concept.* Warp-level Mma operations are function objects satisfying the following concept.

```c++
struct Mma {
  /// Shape of warp-level matrix operation (concept: GemmShape)
  struct Shape;

  /// Data type of multiplicand A (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementA;

  /// Layout of multiplicand A (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutA;

  /// Data type of multiplicand B (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementB;

  /// Layout of multiplicand B (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutB;

  /// Data type of accumulator matrix C (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementC;

  /// Layout of accumulator matrix C (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutC;

  struct IteratorB;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorB (concept: Array<ElementB, ..>)
  struct FragmentB;

  /// Iterator of C operand in shared memory - 
  ///     satisfies: ReadableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept | WriteableRandomAccessTileIteratorConcept
  struct IteratorC;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorC (concept: Array<ElementC, ..>)
  struct FragmentC;

  /// Indicates class of matrix operator (arch::OpClassSimt or arch::OpClassTensorOp)
  struct OperatorClass;

  //
  // Methods
  //

  /// Computes a matrix multiply-accumulate
  CUTLASS_DEVICE
  void operator()(
    FragmentC &D, 
    IteratorA A, 
    IteratorB B, 
    FragmentC const &C);
};
```



*Tensor Core Operators.* Warp-level matrix multiply operators targeting Tensor Cores
may be defined with the following template arguments. The `Policy` type specifies implementation-level details which may 
be used to affect performance or internal implementation of the warp-level operator.

```c++
namespace cutlass {
namespace gemm {
namespace warp {

/// Structure to compute the matrix product targeting CUDA cores and SIMT math instructions.
template <
  /// Size of the Gemm problem - concept: gemm::GemmShape<>
  typename Shape_,
  /// Data type of A elements
  typename ElementA_,
  /// Layout of A matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutA_,
  /// Data type of B elements
  typename ElementB_,
  /// Layout of B matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutB_,
  /// Element type of C matrix
  typename ElementC_,
  /// Layout of C matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutC_,
  /// Shape of the warp in units of thread (concept: MmaSimtPolicy)
  typename Policy_,
  /// Used for partial specialization
  typename Enable = bool
>
class MmaTensorOp {}

} // namespace warp
} // namespace gemm
} // namespace cutlass

```

*SIMT Math Instructions.*  Warp-level matrix multiply operators targeting CUDA Cores
may be defined with the following template arguments. The `Policy` type specifies implementation-level details which may 
be used to affect performance or internal implementation of the warp-level operator.

```c++
/// Structure to compute the matrix product targeting CUDA cores and SIMT math instructions.
template <
  /// Size of the Gemm problem - concept: gemm::GemmShape<>
  typename Shape_,
  /// Data type of A elements
  typename ElementA_,
  /// Layout of A matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutA_,
  /// Data type of B elements
  typename ElementB_,
  /// Layout of B matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutB_,
  /// Element type of C matrix
  typename ElementC_,
  /// Layout of C matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutC_,
  /// Shape of the warp in units of thread (concept: MmaSimtPolicy)
  typename Policy_,
  /// Used for partial specialization
  typename Enable = bool
>
class MmaSimt;
```


## Thread-level GEMM API

Thread-level GEMM operations perform matrix multiply-accumulate on data held in registers. These target CUDA Cores exclusively.

*Concept.* Thread-level matrix multiply operations are function objects satisfying the following concept.
```c++
struct Mma {

  /// Shape of warp-level matrix operation (concept: GemmShape)
  struct Shape;

  /// Data type of multiplicand A (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementA;

  /// Layout of multiplicand A (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutA;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorA (concept: Array<ElementA, ..>)
  struct FragmentA;

  /// Data type of multiplicand B (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementB;

  /// Layout of multiplicand B (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutB;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorA (concept: Array<ElementB, ..>)
  struct FragmentB;

  /// Data type of accumulator matrix C (concept: numeric type)
  struct ElementC;

  /// Layout of accumulator matrix C (concept: Layout)
  struct LayoutC;

  /// Fragment object loaded from IteratorA (concept: Array<ElementC, ..>)
  struct FragmentC;

  //
  // Methods
  //

  /// Computes a matrix multiply-accumulate
  CUTLASS_DEVICE
  void operator()(
    FragmentC &D, 
    FragmentA const &A, 
    FragmentB const &B, 
    FragmentC const &C);
};
```

The CUTLASS thread-level GEMM template accepts the following template arguments.
```c++
namespace cutlass {
namespace gemm {
namespace thread {

/// Structure to compute the matrix product
template <
  /// Size of the Gemm problem - concept: gemm::GemmShape<>
  typename Shape,
  /// Data type of A elements
  typename ElementA,
  /// Layout of A matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutA,
  /// Data type of B elements
  typename ElementB,
  /// Layout of B matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutB,
  /// Element type of C matrix
  typename ElementC,
  /// Layout of C matrix (concept: MatrixLayout)
  typename LayoutC,
  /// Concept: arch::OpMultiplyAdd or arch::Mma<>
  typename Operator = arch::OpMultiplyAdd,
  /// Used for partial specialization
  typename Enable = bool
>
struct Mma;

} // namespace thread
} // namespace gemm
} // namespace cutlass
```

## Efficient Epilogue 

CUTLASS GEMM operators perform mma followed by epilogue operation similar 
to cuBLAS. CUTLASS implements an efficient row-major epilogue. Thus, to achieve 
column-major GEMM, operands A & B are transposed and swapped.

To enable efficient row-major epilogue for both row-major and column-major output layout, 
CUTLASS' device-level GEMM operators `cutlass::device::Gemm` and `cutlass::device::GemmUniversal` 
provide two template definitions:
- (a) [General definition](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm.h#L217)
- (b) [Specialized definition for column-major source/output](/include/cutlass/gemm/device/gemm.h#L545)

Efficient row-major epilogue for:
- (i)  GEMM operator on row-major source/output uses template (a). It runs row-major GEMM and 
an efficient row-major epilogue.
- (ii)  GEMM operator on column-major source/output uses template (b). It transposes and swaps 
operands A and B to enable efficient epilogue. `A x B = C => Transpose(B) x Transpose(A) = Transpose(C)`.
For column-major source (C) matrix, Transpose(C) is row-major, and efficient epilogue works on 
row-major.

Note that cuBLAS typically expects a column-major source (C) and output matrix (D). Thus,
CUTLASS library only instantiates and generates GEMM operatos with column-major layout. However, 
CUTLASS by itself can run both row-major and column-major output layouts for all combinations 
of input layouts. Thus, CUTLASS supports the following layout combinations for input and output layouts: 

- `{N,T} x {N,T} => {N,T}` - NN, TN, TN, TT GEMM for both row-major and column-major output

## Instruction-level operations

CUTLASS defines a template-based interface to Tensor Core operations to avoid resorting
to inline PTX.

- [mma_sm70.h](/include/cutlass/arch/mma_sm70.h) - Volta TensorCore operations
- [mma_sm75.h](/include/cutlass/arch/mma_sm75.h) - Turing TensorCore operations
