What's profiling?
=================
In software engineering, profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures the space (memory) or time
complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls.
Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization.

Briefly, profiler is used to measure application performance. Program analysis tools are extremely important for
understanding program behavior. Simple profiling can tell you that how long does an operation take? For advanced
profiling, it can interpret why does an operation take a long time?

Why we need profiling?
======================
Since training deep neural network typically take a very long time to get over, performance is gradually becoming
the most important thing in deep learning field. The first step to improve performance is to understand what parts
are slow.  There is no point in improving performance of a region which doesn’t take much time!


How to do profiling?
====================
To achieve maximum performance, there are five steps you can take to reach your goals.

- Profile the code
- Find the slow parts
- Work out why they’re slow
- Make them fast
- Profile the code again

Usually, processor has two key performance limits include float point throughput and
memory throughput. For GPU,  it also need more parallelism to fulfill its potential.
This is why they can be so fast.

Profiler Tools
==============
For general GPU profiling, a bunch of tools are provided from both NVIDIA and third party.

**nvprof** is Nvidia profiler and **nvvp** is (GUI based) Nvidia visual profiler.
In this tutorial, we will focus on nvprof and nvvp.

:code:`test_GpuProfiler` from :code:`paddle/math/tests` directory will be used to evaluate
above profilers. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../paddle/math/tests/test_GpuProfiler.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 111-124
   :linenos:

The above code snippet includes two methods, you can use any of them to profile the regions of interest.

1. :code:`REGISTER_TIMER_INFO` is a built-in timer wrapper which can calculate the time overhead of both cpu functions and cuda kernels.

2. :code:`REGISTER_GPU_PROFILER` is a general purpose wrapper object of :code:`cudaProfilerStart` and :code:`cudaProfilerStop` to avoid
program crashes when CPU version of PaddlePaddle invokes them.

You can find more details about how to use both of them in the next session.

Hands-on Approach
=================

Built-in Timer
--------------

To enable built-in timer in PaddlePaddle, first you have to add :code:`REGISTER_TIMER_INFO` into the regions of you interest.
Then, all information could be stamped in the console via :code:`printStatus` or :code:`printAllStatus` function.
As a simple example, consider the following:

1. Add :code:`REGISTER_TIMER_INFO` and :code:`printAllStatus` functions (see the emphasize-lines).

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../paddle/math/tests/test_GpuProfiler.cpp
        :language: c++
        :lines: 111-124
        :emphasize-lines: 8-10,13
        :linenos:

2. Configure cmake with **WITH_TIMER** and recompile PaddlePaddle.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cmake .. -DWITH_TIMER=ON
        make

3. Execute your code and observe the results (see the emphasize-lines). 

    .. code-block:: bash
        :emphasize-lines: 1,12-15

nvprof profiler
---------------

To use this command line profiler **nvprof**, you can simply issue the following command:

1. Add :code:`REGISTER_GPU_PROFILER` function (see the emphasize-lines).

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../paddle/math/tests/test_GpuProfiler.cpp
        :language: c++
        :lines: 111-124
        :emphasize-lines: 6-7
        :linenos:

2. Configure cmake with **WITH_PROFILER** and recompile PaddlePaddle.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cmake .. -DWITH_PROFILER=ON
        make

3. Use Nvidia profiler **nvprof** to profile the binary.

    .. code-block:: bash

        nvprof  ./paddle/math/tests/test_GpuProfiler

Then, you can get the following profiling result:

.. code-block:: bash

nvvp profiler
-------------

For visual profiler **nvvp**, you can either import the output of :code:`nvprof –o ...` or
run application through GUI.

**Note: nvvp also support CPU profiling** (Click the box in nvvp to enable profile execution on CPU).

    :scale: 33%

From the perspective of kernel functions, **nvvp** can even illustrate why does an operation take a long time?
As shown in the following figure, kernel's block usage, register usage and shared memory usage from :code:`nvvp`
allow us to fully utilize all warps on the GPU.

From the perspective of application, **nvvp** can give you some suggestions to address performance bottleneck.
For instance, some advice in data movement and compute utilization from the below figure can guide you to tune performance.

Profiling tips
==============

- The **nvprof** and **nvvp** output is a very good place to start.
- The timeline is a good place to go next.
- Only dig deep into a kernel if it’s taking a significant amount of your time.
- Where possible, try to match profiler output with theory.
    1) For example, if I know I’m moving 1GB, and my kernel takes 10ms, I expect the profiler to report 100GB/s.
    2) Discrepancies are likely to mean your application isn’t doing what you thought it was.
- Know your hardware: If your GPU can do 6 TFLOPs, and you’re already doing 5.5 TFLOPs, you won’t go much faster!


Profiling is a key step in optimization. Sometimes quite simple changes can lead to big improvements in performance.
Your mileage may vary!
