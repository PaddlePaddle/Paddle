# Build PaddlePaddle for Raspberry Pi

We use one of the follow two approaches to build the inference library of PaddlePaddle for Raspberry Pi:

1. Log in to a Raspberry Pi via SSH and build.  [`/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/Dockerfile) lists the required development tools and third-party dependencies.

1. An alternative is cross-compiling.  This article explains cross-compiling PaddlePaddle for Raspberry Pi on a Linux/x64 computer.
