	docker_install_en.rst

We recommend running PaddlePaddle in Docker. This method has the following advantages：

- Does not require installation of third-party dependencies. 
- Easy to share runtime environment. 

Lastly, users can also compile and install PaddlePaddle from source code. The instructions are below:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    build_from_source_en.rst

.. warning::

	One caveat with this approach is that developers will have to download, compile and install all third-party dependencies. Thus this process of installation is more time consuming.
