Set Command-line Parameters
===========================
The implementation of deep learning algorithms has a variety of characteristics，such as running environment, running stage, structure of the model and the traning strategy. PaddlePaddle supports the user to set various command-line parameters flexibly, which helps to achieve control of the model training or prediction process.

In this part，we take several actual scenarios as an example, and the use of some command-line parameters is displayed:

..  toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  use_case_cn.md

Then, we summarize and classify the use of all command-line parameters:

..  toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  arguments_cn.md

Finally, the detailed descriptions are given, and we try to explain the propeties and significance of these command-line parameters in detail:
