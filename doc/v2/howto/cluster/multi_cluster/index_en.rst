Use different clusters
======================

The user's cluster environment is not the same. To facilitate everyone's deployment, we provide a variety of cluster deployment methods to facilitate the submission of cluster training tasks, which will be introduced as follows:

`Kubernetes <http://kubernetes.io>`_ is a scheduling framework of Google open source container cluster, supporting a complete cluster solution for large-scale cluster production environment. The following guidelines show PaddlePaddle's support for Kubernetes:

`OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org>`_ is a mature high-performance parallel computing framework, which is widely used in the field of HPC. The following guide describes how to use OpenMPI to build PaddlePaddle's cluster training task:
