### Backgroud
The data loading and preprocessing for training and inference in fluid is not very convenient to use.

Some problems are listed here:
- complicated to compose multiple 'readers' 
- not easy to adapt new file format with custom data records
- no common preprocessing pipeline for image
- efficient in data reading and processing need to be optimized
