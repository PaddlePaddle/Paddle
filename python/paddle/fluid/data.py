    **Data Layer**

    This function creates a variable on the global block. The global variable
    can be accessed by all the following operators in the graph. The variable
    is a placeholder that could be feeded with input, such as Executor can feed
    input into the variable.

    Note: 
       `paddle.fluid.layers.data` is deprecated. It will be removed in a future
       version. Please use this `paddle.fluid.data`. 
       
       The `paddle.fluid.layers.data` set shape and dtype at compile time but
       does NOT check the shape or the dtype of feeded data, this
       `paddle.fluid.data` checks the shape and the dtype of data feeded by
       Executor or ParallelExecutor during run time.

    Args:
       name (str): The name/alias of the variable, see :ref:`api_guide_Name`
           for more details.
       shape (list|tuple): List|Tuple of integers declaring the shape. You can
           set "None" at a dimension to indicate the dimension can be of any
           size. For example, it is useful to set changable batch size as "None" 
       dtype (np.dtype|VarType|str, optional): The type of the data. Supported
           dtype: bool, float16, float32, float64, int8, int16, int32, int64,
           uint8. Default: float32
       lod_level (int, optional): The LoD level of the LoDTensor. Usually users
           don't have to set this value. For more details about when and how to
           use LoD level, see :ref:`user_guide_lod_tensor` . Default: 0

    Returns:
        Variable: The global variable that gives access to the data.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

          x = fluid.data(name='x', shape=[3, 2, 1], dtype='float32')

          # Creates a variable with changable batch size.
          # Users can feed data of any batch size into y,
          # but size of each data sample has to be [2, 1]
          y = fluid.data(name='y', shape=[None, 2, 1], dtype='float32')

          z = x + y

          # In this example, we will feed x and y with np-ndarry "1"
          # and fetch z, like implementing "1 + 1 = 2" in PaddlePaddle
          feed_data = np.ones(shape=[3, 2, 1], dtype=np.float32)
