def create_lod_tensor(data, recursive_seq_lens, place):
    """
    Create a lod tensor from a numpy array, a list, or an existing lod tensor.

    Create a lod tensor by doing the following:

    1. Check that the length-based level of detail (LoD) also known as
       recursive_sequence_lengths of the input is valid.

    2. Convert recursive_sequence_lengths to a offset-based LoD.

    3. Copy the data from a numpy array, a list or a existing lod tensor to
       CPU or GPU device (based on input place).

    4. Set the level of detail (LoD) using the offset-based LoD.

    Examples:

        Suppose we want LoDTensor to hold data for sequences of word, where each
        word is represented by an integer. If we want to create a LoDTensor to
        represent two sentences, one of 2 words, and one of 3 words.

        Then :code:`data` can be a numpy array of integers with shape (5, 1).
        :code:`recursive_seq_lens` will be [[2, 3]], indicating the length(# of words) in each
        sentence. This length-based :code:`recursive_seq_lens` [[2, 3]] will be converted to
        offset-based LoD [[0, 2, 5]] inside the function call.

        .. code-block:: python

          import paddle.fluid as fluid
          import numpy as np

          t = fluid.create_lod_tensor(np.ndarray([5, 30]), [[2, 3]], fluid.CPUPlace())

    Please reference :ref:`api_guide_low_level_lod_tensor` for more details
    regarding LoD.

    Args:
        data(numpy.ndarray|list|LoDTensor): a numpy array or a LoDTensor or a
            list holding the data to be copied.

            info specified by the user.
        place(Place): CPU or GPU place indicating where the data in the new
            LoDTensor will be stored.

    Create a LoDTensor containing random integers.

    This function is frequently used in the book examples. So we revised it
    based on the new create_lod_tensor API and put it here in the lod_tensor
    module to simplify the code.

    The function does the following:

    1. Calculate the overall shape of the LoDTensor based on the length-based
       :code:`recursive_seq_lens` input and the shape of the basic element in
       :code:`base_shape`.

    2. Create a numpy array of this shape.

    3. Create the LoDTensor using create_lod_tensor API.

    Suppose we want LoDTensor to hold data for sequences of word, where each
    word is represented by an integer. If we want to create a LoDTensor to
    represent two sentences, one of 2 words, and one of 3 words. Then
    'base_shape' is [1], input length-based 'recursive_seq_lens' is [[2, 3]].
    Then the overall shape of the LoDTensor would be [5, 1], holding 5 words
    for two sentences.

        recursive_seq_lens(list): a list of lists indicating the length-based
            level of detail info specified by the user.
        base_shape(list): the shape of the basic element to be held by the
            LoDTensor.
        place(Place): CPU or GPU place indicating where the data in the new
            LoDTensor will be stored.
        low(int): the lower bound of the random integers.
        high(int): the upper bound of the random integers.
