    A base implement of batch sampler used by `fluid.io.DataLoader`

    mini-batch size and holds sample indices) iterably.

    Batch sampler used by `fluid.io.DataLoader` should be a subclass
    of `fluid.io.BatchSampler`, BatchSampler subclasses should
    implement following methods:

    :math:`__iter__`: return mini-batch indices iterably.
    :math:`__len__`: get mini-batch number in an epoch.

                     `__len__` for BatchSampler to get sample
