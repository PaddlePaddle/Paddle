    **Detection Output Layer for Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD).**

    This operation is to get the detection results by performing following
    two steps:

    1. Decode input bounding box predictions according to the prior boxes.
    2. Get the final detection results by applying multi-class non maximum
       suppression (NMS).

    Please note, this operation doesn't clip the final output bounding boxes
    to the image window.

    Args:
        loc(Variable): A 3-D Tensor with shape [N, M, 4] represents the
            predicted locations of M bounding bboxes. N is the batch size,
            and each bounding box has four coordinate values and the layout
            is [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax].
        scores(Variable): A 3-D Tensor with shape [N, M, C] represents the
            predicted confidence predictions. N is the batch size, C is the
            class number, M is number of bounding boxes. For each category
            there are total M scores which corresponding M bounding boxes.
        prior_box(Variable): A 2-D Tensor with shape [M, 4] holds M boxes,
            each box is represented as [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax],
            [xmin, ymin] is the left top coordinate of the anchor box,
            if the input is image feature map, they are close to the origin
            of the coordinate system. [xmax, ymax] is the right bottom
            coordinate of the anchor box.
        prior_box_var(Variable): A 2-D Tensor with shape [M, 4] holds M group
            of variance.
        background_label(float): The index of background label,
            the background label will be ignored. If set to -1, then all
            categories will be considered.
        nms_threshold(float): The threshold to be used in NMS.
        nms_top_k(int): Maximum number of detections to be kept according
            to the confidences aftern the filtering detections based on
            score_threshold.
        keep_top_k(int): Number of total bboxes to be kept per image after
            NMS step. -1 means keeping all bboxes after NMS step.
        score_threshold(float): Threshold to filter out bounding boxes with
            low confidence score. If not provided, consider all boxes.
        nms_eta(float): The parameter for adaptive NMS.

    Returns:
        Variable: 
        
            The detection outputs is a LoDTensor with shape [No, 6].
            Each row has six values: [label, confidence, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax].
            `No` is the total number of detections in this mini-batch. For each
            instance, the offsets in first dimension are called LoD, the offset
            number is N + 1, N is the batch size. The i-th image has
            `LoD[i + 1] - LoD[i]` detected results, if it is 0, the i-th image
            has no detected results. If all images have not detected results,
            all the elements in LoD are 0, and output tensor only contains one
            value, which is -1.

    """
    This operator implements a greedy bipartite matching algorithm, which is
    used to obtain the matching with the maximum distance based on the input
    distance matrix. For input 2D matrix, the bipartite matching algorithm can
    find the matched column for each row (matched means the largest distance),
    also can find the matched row for each column. And this operator only
    calculate matched indices from column to row. For each instance,
    the number of matched indices is the column number of the input distance
    matrix.

    There are two outputs, matched indices and distance.
    A simple description, this algorithm matched the best (maximum distance)
    row entity to the column entity and the matched indices are not duplicated
    in each row of ColToRowMatchIndices. If the column entity is not matched
    any row entity, set -1 in ColToRowMatchIndices.

    NOTE: the input DistMat can be LoDTensor (with LoD) or Tensor.
    If LoDTensor with LoD, the height of ColToRowMatchIndices is batch size.
    If Tensor, the height of ColToRowMatchIndices is 1.

    NOTE: This API is a very low level API. It is used by :code:`ssd_loss`
    layer. Please consider to use :code:`ssd_loss` instead.

    Args:
        dist_matrix(Variable): This input is a 2-D LoDTensor with shape
            [K, M]. It is pair-wise distance matrix between the entities
            represented by each row and each column. For example, assumed one
            entity is A with shape [K], another entity is B with shape [M]. The
            dist_matrix[i][j] is the distance between A[i] and B[j]. The bigger
            the distance is, the better matching the pairs are.

            NOTE: This tensor can contain LoD information to represent a batch
            of inputs. One instance of this batch can contain different numbers
            of entities.
        match_type(string|None): The type of matching method, should be
           'bipartite' or 'per_prediction'. [default 'bipartite'].
        dist_threshold(float|None): If `match_type` is 'per_prediction',

    Returns:
        tuple: a tuple with two elements is returned. The first is
        matched_indices, the second is matched_distance.

        The matched_indices is a 2-D Tensor with shape [N, M] in int type.
        N is the batch size. If match_indices[i][j] is -1, it
        means B[j] does not match any entity in i-th instance.
        Otherwise, it means B[j] is matched to row
        match_indices[i][j] in i-th instance. The row number of
        i-th instance is saved in match_indices[i][j].

        The matched_distance is a 2-D Tensor with shape [N, M] in float type
        . N is batch size. If match_indices[i][j] is -1,
        match_distance[i][j] is also -1.0. Otherwise, assumed
        match_distance[i][j] = d, and the row offsets of each instance

           the j-th entity of column is not matched to any entity of row in
