    r"""
    This operator implements the cross entropy loss function with softmax. This function
    combines the calculation of the softmax operation and the cross entropy loss function
    to provide a more numerically stable gradient.
    Because this operator performs a softmax on logits internally, it expects
    unscaled logits. This operator should not be used with the output of
    softmax operator since that would produce incorrect results.
    When the attribute :attr:`soft_label` is set :attr:`False`, this operators
    expects mutually exclusive hard labels, each sample in a batch is in exactly
    one class with a probability of 1.0. Each sample in the batch will have a
    single label.
    The equation is as follows:
    1) Hard label (one-hot label, so every sample has exactly one class)
    .. math::
        loss_j =  -\\text{logits}_{label_j} +
        \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{K}\\exp(\\text{logits}_i)\\right), j = 1,..., K
    2) Soft label (each sample can have a distribution over all classes)
    .. math::
        loss_j =  -\\sum_{i=0}^{K}\\text{label}_i
        \\left(\\text{logits}_i - \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{K}
        \\exp(\\text{logits}_i)\\right)\\right), j = 1,...,K
    3) If :attr:`numeric_stable_mode` is :attr:`True`, softmax is calculated first by:
    .. math::
        max_j &= \\max_{i=0}^{K}{\\text{logits}_i}
        log\\_max\\_sum_j &= \\log\\sum_{i=0}^{K}\\exp(logits_i - max_j)
        softmax_j &= \\exp(logits_j - max_j - {log\\_max\\_sum}_j)
    and then cross entropy loss is calculated by softmax and label.
    Args:
        logits (Tensor): A multi-dimension ``Tensor`` , and the data type is float32 or float64. The input tensor of unscaled log probabilities.
        label (Tensor): The ground truth  ``Tensor`` , data type is the same
            as the ``logits`` . If :attr:`soft_label` is set to :attr:`True`,
            Label is a ``Tensor``  in the same shape with :attr:`logits`.
            If :attr:`soft_label` is set to :attr:`True`, Label is a ``Tensor``
            in the same shape with :attr:`logits` expect shape in dimension :attr:`axis` as 1.
        soft_label (bool, optional): A flag to indicate whether to interpretant the given
            labels as soft labels. Default False.
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored and does
                                      not contribute to the input gradient. Only valid
                                      if :attr:`soft_label` is set to :attr:`False`.
                                      Default: kIgnoreIndex(-100).
        numeric_stable_mode (bool, optional): A flag to indicate whether to use a more
                                              numerically stable algorithm. Only valid
                                              when :attr:`soft_label` is :attr:`False`
                                              and GPU is used. When :attr:`soft_label`
                                              is :attr:`True` or CPU is used, the
                                              algorithm is always numerically stable.
                                              Note that the speed may be slower when use
                                              stable algorithm. Default: True.
        return_softmax (bool, optional): A flag indicating whether to return the softmax
                                         along with the cross entropy loss. Default: False.
        axis (int, optional): The index of dimension to perform softmax calculations. It
                              should be in range :math:`[-1, rank - 1]`, while :math:`rank`
                              is the rank of input :attr:`logits`. Default: -1.
    Returns:
        ``Tensor`` or Tuple of two ``Tensor`` : Return the cross entropy loss if \
                                                    `return_softmax` is False, otherwise the tuple \
                                                    (loss, softmax), softmax is in the same shape \
                                                    with input logits and cross entropy loss is in \
                                                    the same shape with input logits except shape \
                                                    in dimension :attr:`axis` as 1.
