class ParallelExecutor(object):
    """
    ParallelExecutor is designed for data parallelism, which focuses on distributing
    the data across different nodes and every node operates on the data in parallel.
    If you use ParallelExecutor to run the current program on GPU, the node means GPU
    device, and ParallelExecutor will get the available GPU device automatically on
    the current machine. If you use ParallelExecutor to run the current program on CPU,
    the node means the CPU device, and you can specify the CPU device number by adding
    'CPU_NUM' environment variable, for example 'CPU_NUM=4', if the environment variable
    is not found, ParallelExecutor will call `multiprocessing.cpu_count` to get the number
    of CPUs in the system.

    Args:
        use_cuda (bool): Whether to use CUDA or not.
        loss_name (str): The loss name must set in training. Default None.
        main_program (Program): The program that need to run, if not provided,
            then default_main_program will be used. Default None.
        share_vars_from(ParallelExecutor): If provide, it will share variables
            from the specified ParallelExecutor. Default None.
        exec_strategy(ExecutionStrategy): exec_strategy is used to control how to run
            the program in ParallelExecutor, for example how many threads are used to
            execute the program, how many iterations to clean up the temp variables
            which is generated during execution. For more information, please refer
            to fluid.ExecutionStrategy. Default None.
        build_strategy(BuildStrategy): build_strategy is used to control how to
            build the SSA Graph in ParallelExecutor by setting the property,
            for example reduce_strategy, gradient_scale_strategy. For more information,
            please refer to fluid.BuildStrategy. Default None.
        num_trainers(int): If greater than 1, NCCL will be initialized with
            multiple rank of nodes, each node should have same number of GPUs.
            Distributed training will be enabled then. Default 1.
        trainer_id(int): Must use together with num_trainers. trainer_id is the
            "rank" of current node starts from 0. Default 0.
        scope(Scope): scope to run with, default use fluid.global_scope().

    Returns:
        ParallelExecutor: The initialized ParallelExecutor object.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If share_vars_from is provided, but not ParallelExecutor object.

        Run a parallel executor with fetch_list.

        The feed parameter can be a dict or a list. If feed is a dict, the
        feed data will be split into multiple devices. If feed is a list, we
        assume the data has been splitted into multiple devices, the each
        element in the list will be copied to each device directly.

        For example, if the feed is a dict:

        >>> exe = ParallelExecutor()

        NOTES:
            1. If the feed's type is dict, the number of data that feeds to
               ParallelExecutor must be bigger than active places. Otherwise,
               it will throw exception from C++ side. Special attention should be
               paid to check whether the last batch of the dataset is bigger
               than active places.
            2. If active places are more than one, the fetch results for each
               variable is a list, and each element of this list is the variable of
               respective active place.
