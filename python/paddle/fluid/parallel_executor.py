class ParallelExecutor(object):
    """
    ParallelExecutor is designed for data parallelism, which focuses on distributing
    the data across different nodes and every node operates on the data in parallel.
    If you use ParallelExecutor to run the current program on GPU, the node means GPU
    device, and ParallelExecutor will get the available GPU device automatically on
    the current machine. If you use ParallelExecutor to run the current program on CPU,
    the node means the CPU device, and you can specify the CPU device number by adding
    'CPU_NUM' environment variable, for example 'CPU_NUM=4', if the environment variable
    is not found, ParallelExecutor will call `multiprocessing.cpu_count` to get the number
    of CPUs in the system.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

          import paddle.fluid as fluid

          # in that case, the batch size of the input should be
          # greater than CPU_NUM, if not, the process will be

        Drop the local execution scope immediately.

        During the execution of the Program, the generate intermediate

        creation and deletion of those intermediate results are time-consuming.
        To resolve that problem, ParallelExecutor provides an option in

        indicates how many iterations to run before dropping the local execution
        scope. But in some situation, each iteration generates different
        intermediate results, it will lead to the result that the memory which
        is needed by local execution scope gradually increase. And if you want
