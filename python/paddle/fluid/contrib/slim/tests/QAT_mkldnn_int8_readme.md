# SLIM Quantization-aware training (QAT) on INT8 MKL-DNN

This document describes how to use [Paddle Slim](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FluidDoc/blob/develop/doc/fluid/advanced_usage/paddle_slim/paddle_slim.md) to convert a quantization-aware trained model to INT8 MKL-DNN quantized model. In **Release 1.5**, we have released the QAT1.0 MKL-DNN which enabled the INT8 MKL-DNN kernel for QAT trained model within 0.05% accuracy diff on GoogleNet, MobileNet-V1, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-101, ResNet-50, VGG16 and VGG19. In **Release 1.6**, QAT2.0 MKL-DNN, we did the performance optimization based on fake QAT models: ResNet50, ResNet101, Mobilenet-v1, Mobilenet-v2, VGG16 and VGG19 with the minor accuracy drop. Compared with Release 1.5, the QAT2.0 MKL-DNN got better performance gain on inference compared with fake QAT models but got a little bit bigger accuracy diff. In **Release 1.7**, a support for [Ernie (NLP) QAT trained model](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/benchmark/tree/master/Inference/c%2B%2B/ernie) was added to the QAT2.0 MKL-DNN. We provide the accuracy benchmark both for QAT1.0 MKL-DNN and QAT2.0 MKL-DNN, and performance benchmark on QAT2.0 MKL-DNN.  

Notes:

* MKL-DNN and MKL are required. The performance gain can only be obtained with AVX512 series CPU servers.
* INT8 accuracy is best on CPU servers supporting AVX512 VNNI extension.

## 0. Prerequisite
You need to install at least PaddlePaddle-1.7 python package `pip install paddlepaddle==1.7`.

## 1. How to generate INT8 MKL-DNN QAT model
You can refer to the unit test in [test_quantization_mkldnn_pass.py](test_quantization_mkldnn_pass.py). Users firstly use PaddleSlim quantization strategy to get a saved fake QAT model by [QuantizationFreezePass](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models/tree/develop/PaddleSlim/quant_low_level_api), then use the `QatInt8MkldnnPass` (from QAT1.0 MKL-DNN) to get a graph which can be run with MKL-DNN INT8 kernel. In Paddle Release 1.6, this pass supports `conv2d` and `depthwise_conv2d` ops with channel-wise quantization for weights. Apart from it, another pass called `Qat2Int8MkldnnPass` (from QAT2.0 MKL-DNN) is available for use. In Release 1.6, this pass additionally supports `pool2d` op and allows users to transform their QAT model into a highly performance-optimized INT8 model that is ran using INT8 MKL-DNN kernels. In Release 1.7, a support for `fc`, `reshape2` and `transpose2` ops was added to the pass.

```python
    import paddle.fluid as fluid
    from paddle.fluid.contrib.slim.quantization import QatInt8MkldnnPass
    from paddle.fluid.contrib.slim.quantization import Qat2Int8MkldnnPass
    from paddle.fluid.framework import IrGraph
    from paddle.fluid import core	
    
    # Create the IrGraph by Program
    graph = IrGraph(core.Graph(fluid.Program().desc), for_test=False)
    place = fluid.CPUPlace()
    # Convert the IrGraph to MKL-DNN supported INT8 IrGraph by using
    # QAT1.0 MKL-DNN
    # QatInt8MkldnnPass
    mkldnn_pass = QatInt8MkldnnPass(fluid.global_scope(), place)
    # Apply QatInt8MkldnnPass to IrGraph
    mkldnn_pass.apply(graph)
    # QAT2.0 MKL-DNN
    # Qat2Int8MkldnnPass, it requires a list of operators to be quantized
    mkldnn_pass = Qat2Int8MkldnnPass({'conv2d', 'pool2d'}, fluid.global_scope(), place, fluid.core, False)
    # Apply Qat2Int8MkldnnPass to IrGraph
    mkldnn_pass.apply(graph)

```

## 3. How to reproduce the results
Three steps are needed to reproduce the above-mentioned accuracy and performance results.  Below we explain the steps taking ResNet50 as an example of image classification models. In order to reproduce NLP results, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/benchmark/tree/master/Inference/c%2B%2B/ernie/mkldnn/README.md).
### Prepare dataset

#### Image classification

In order to download the dataset for image classification models benchmarking, execute:

```bash
cd /PATH/TO/PADDLE
python paddle/fluid/inference/tests/api/full_ILSVRC2012_val_preprocess.py
```
The converted data binary file is saved by default in `$HOME/.cache/paddle/dataset/int8/download/int8_full_val.bin`

### Prepare model

#### Image classification
You can run the following commands to download ResNet50 model. The exemplary code snippet provided below downloads a ResNet50 QAT model. The reason for having two different versions of the same model originates from having two different QAT training strategies: One for an non-optimized and second for an optimized graph transform which correspond to QAT1.0 and QAT2.0 respectively.

```bash
mkdir -p /PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/MODEL/
cd /PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/MODEL/
# uncomment for QAT1.0 MKL-DNN
# export MODEL_NAME=ResNet50
# export MODEL_FILE_NAME=QAT_models/${MODEL_NAME}_qat_model.tar.gz
# uncomment for QAT2.0 MKL-DNN
# export MODEL_NAME=resnet50
# export MODEL_FILE_NAME=QAT2_models/${MODEL_NAME}_quant.tar.gz
wget http://paddle-inference-dist.bj.bcebos.com/int8/${MODEL_FILE_NAME}
mkdir ${MODEL_NAME} && tar -xvf ResNet50_qat_model.tar.gz -C ${MODEL_NAME}
```

Extract the downloaded model to the folder. To verify all the 7 models, you need to set `MODEL_NAME` to one of the following values in command line:
```text
QAT1.0 models
MODEL_NAME=ResNet50, ResNet101, GoogleNet, MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19
QAT2.0 models
MODEL_NAME=resnet50, resnet101, mobilenetv1, mobilenetv2, vgg16, vgg19
```
### Commands to reproduce benchmark

#### Image classification
You can use the `qat_int8_image_classification_comparison.py` script to reproduce the accuracy result on ResNet50. The difference between commands usedin the QAT1.0 MKL-DNN and QAT2.0 MKL-DNN is that for QAT2.0 MKL-DNN two additional options are required: the `--qat2` option to enable QAT2.0 MKL-DNN, and the `--quantized_ops` option with a comma-separated list of operators to be quantized. To perform the QAT2.0 MKL-DNN performance test, the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and `--batch_size=1` option should be set.
>*QAT1.0*

- Accuracy benchmark command on QAT1.0 models

```bash
cd /PATH/TO/PADDLE
OMP_NUM_THREADS=28 FLAGS_use_mkldnn=true python python/paddle/fluid/contrib/slim/tests/qat_int8_image_classification_comparison.py --qat_model=/PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/MODEL/${MODEL_NAME}/model --infer_data=$HOME/.cache/paddle/dataset/int8/download/int8_full_val.bin --batch_size=50 --batch_num=1000 --acc_diff_threshold=0.001
```
>*QAT2.0*

- Accuracy benchamrk command on QAT2.0 models
```bash
cd /PATH/TO/PADDLE
OMP_NUM_THREADS=28 FLAGS_use_mkldnn=true python python/paddle/fluid/contrib/slim/tests/qat_int8_image_classification_comparison.py ----qat_model=/PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/MODEL/${MODEL_NAME}_quant --infer_data=$HOME/.cache/paddle/dataset/int8/download/int8_full_val.bin --batch_size=50 --batch_num=1000 --acc_diff_threshold=0.01 --qat2 --quantized_ops="conv2d,pool2d"
```

* Performance benchmark command on QAT2.0 models

In order to run performance benchmark, follow the steps below.

1. Save QAT2.0 INT8 model. You can use the script `save_qat_model.py` for this purpose. It also requires the option `--quantized_ops`  to indicate which operators are to be quantized.

   ```bash
   cd /PATH/TO/PADDLE/build
   python ../python/paddle/fluid/contrib/slim/tests/save_qat_model.py --qat_model_path=/PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/MODEL/${QAT2_MODEL_NAME} --int8_model_save_path=/PATH/TO/${QAT2_MODEL_NAME}_qat_int8 --quantized_ops="conv2d,pool2d"
   ```

2. Run the QAT2.0 C-API test for performance benchmark.

   ```bash
   cd /PATH/TO/PADDLE/build
   OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 paddle/fluid/inference/tests/api/test_analyzer_qat_image_classification ARGS --enable_fp32=false --with_accuracy_layer=false --int8_model=/PATH/TO/${QAT2_MODEL_NAME}_qat_int8 --infer_data=$HOME/.cache/paddle/dataset/int8/download/int8_full_val.bin --batch_size=1 --paddle_num_threads=1
   ```

> Notes: Due to a large amount of images contained in `int8_full_val.bin` dataset (50 000), the accuracy benchmark which includes comparison of unoptimized and optimized QAT model may last long (even several hours). To accelerate the process, it is recommended to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to the max number of physical cores available on the server.
