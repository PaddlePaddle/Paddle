class RowConv(layers.Layer):

    ***Row-convolution operator***

    The row convolution is called lookahead convolution.  This operator was introduced in the following paper for DeepSpeech2:
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dyogatam/papers/wang+etal.iclrworkshop2016.pdf

    The main motivation is that a bidirectional RNN, useful in DeepSpeech like speech models, learns representation for a sequence by performing a
    forward and a backward pass through the entire sequence. However, unlike
    unidirectional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs are challenging to deploy in an online
    and low-latency setting. The lookahead convolution incorporates information
    from future subsequences in a computationally efficient manner to improve
    unidirectional recurrent neural networks. The row convolution operator is
    different from the 1D sequence convolution, and is computed as follows:

    Given an input sequence X of length t and input dimension D, and a filter (W) of size context * D.

    More details about row_conv please refer to the design document https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/2228#issuecomment-303903645 .

    Parameters:
        name_scope(str): The name of this class.
        future_context_size (int): Future context size. Please note, the shape
            of convolution kernel is [future_context_size + 1, D].
        param_attr (ParamAttr): Attributes of parameters, including
            name, initializer etc. Default: None.
        act (str): Non-linear activation to be applied to output variable. Default: None.

    Attributes:
        weight (Parameter): the learnable weights of this layer.

    Returns:
        the output(Out) is a LodTensor, which supports variable time-length input sequences.
        The underlying tensor in this LodTensor is a matrix with shape T x N, i.e., the same shape as X.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

          import paddle.fluid as fluid
          import numpy

          with fluid.dygraph.guard():
              x = numpy.random.random((16)).astype('float32')
              rowConv = fluid.dygraph.nn.RowConv(
                    'RowConv', future_context_size=2)
              ret = rowConv(fluid.dygraph.base.to_variable(x))
