def fused_rotary_position_embedding(q, k, v):
    r"""
    Fused rotary position embedding.

    Args:
        q (Tensor): The input tensor. The data type is bfloat16, float16, float32 or float64. The shape if q must be [batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim] and head_dim must be a multiple of 2.
        k (potional|Tensor): The input tensor. The data type is bfloat16, float16, float32 or float64. The shape if k must be [batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim] and head_dim must be a multiple of 2.

        v (potional|Tensor): The input tensor. The data type is bfloat16, float16, float32 or float64. The shape if v must be [batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim] and head_dim must be a multiple of 2.


    Returns:
        out_q/out_k/out_v Tensor representing the fused rotary position embedding, has same shape and data type as `q` .


    Examples:

        ..  code-block:: python

            # required: gpu
            import paddle
            from paddle.incubate.nn.functional import fused_rotary_position_embedding

            k = paddle.randn([1, 1, 4, 10], dtype='float16')
            v = paddle.randn([1, 1, 4, 10], dtype='float16')
            out_q, out_k, out_v = fused_rotary_position_embedding(q, k, v)
