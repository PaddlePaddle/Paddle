def identity_loss(x, reduction="none"):
    r"""Marks a tensor as being part of the loss calculation for IPU.

    This operator is used to handle on the (final) loss of a model so that
    it is used as the start of backpropagation.

    When `reduction` is `none`, return raw `Out`.

    When `reduction` is `mean`, return

    .. math::
        Out = MEAN(Out)

    When `reduction` is `sum`, return

    .. math::
        Out = SUM(Out)

    Parameters:
        x (Variable): The input tensor. The shapes is [N, *], where N is batch size and `*` means any number of
             additional dimensions. It's data type should be float32, float64 on CPU and float16, float32 on IPU.
        reduction(str|int, optional): Reduce the loss output. Supported string values are: 'sum', 'mean', 'none'
                            the corresponding int values are 0, 1, 2 respectively. The default value is "none".

    Returns:
        Variable: The loss ``Tensor`` with the specified reduction applied.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python

            import paddle
            paddle.enable_static()
            loss = paddle.static.data(name="loss", shape=[-1, 1], dtype="float32")
            out = paddle.incubate.identity_loss(loss, reduction=1)
    """

        if reduction is None:
            raise Exception("Unsupported reduction type.")
