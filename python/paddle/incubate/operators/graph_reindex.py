    Graph Reindex API.

    This API is mainly used in Graph Learning domain, which should be used
    in conjunction with `graph_sample_neighbors` API. And the main purpose
    is to reindex the ids information of the input nodes, and return the 
    corresponding graph edges after reindex.

    **Notes**: 
        The number in x should be unique, otherwise it would cause potential errors.
    Besides, we also support multi-edge-types neighbors reindexing. If we have different
    edge_type neighbors for x, we should concatenate all the neighbors and count of x. 
    We will reindex all the nodes from 0. 

    Take input nodes x = [0, 1, 2] as an example. 
    If we have neighbors = [8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 7], and count = [2, 3, 2], 
    then we know that the neighbors of 0 is [8, 9], the neighbors of 1
    is [0, 4, 7], and the neighbors of 2 is [6, 7].

    Args:
        x (Tensor): The input nodes which we sample neighbors for. The available
                    data type is int32, int64.
        neighbors (Tensor): The neighbors of the input nodes `x`. The data type
                            should be the same with `x`.
        count (Tensor): The neighbor count of the input nodes `x`. And the 
                        data type should be int32.
        value_buffer (Tensor|None): Value buffer for hashtable. The data type should 
                                    be int32, and should be filled with -1.
        index_buffer (Tensor|None): Index buffer for hashtable. The data type should 
                                    be int32, and should be filled with -1.
        flag_buffer_hashtable (bool): Whether to use buffer for hashtable to speed up.
                                      Default is False. Only useful for gpu version currently.
        name (str, optional): Name for the operation (optional, default is None).
                              For more information, please refer to :ref:`api_guide_Name`.
    
    Returns:
        reindex_src (Tensor): The source node index of graph edges after reindex.
        reindex_dst (Tensor): The destination node index of graph edges after reindex.
        out_nodes (Tensor): The index of unique input nodes and neighbors before reindex,
                            where we put the input nodes `x` in the front, and put neighbor
                            nodes in the back.
