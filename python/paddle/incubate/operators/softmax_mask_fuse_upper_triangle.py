def softmax_mask_fuse_upper_triangle(x):
    """
    Do a masked softmax on x, which will always mask upper triangle part of x.

    This is designed for speeding up GPT kind Transformer structure.
    Used for reducing operation such as: tmp = x + mask, out = softmax(tmp), where the mask is
    always be an upper triangle matrix.
    The equation is:

    .. math::
        out = softmax(LowerTriangular(x))

    **Note**:
        This API only supports GPU.

    Args:
        x (4-D Tensor): The input tensor, should be in 4D shape, it's data type should be float16, float32
                        The fourth dimension of x must be larger or equal to 32 and less then 8192.
                        The third dimension of x must be same with the fourth dimension of x.

    Returns:
        4-D Tensor. A location into which the result is stored. Itâ€™s dimension is 4D. Has same dimension with x.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

            # required: gpu
            import paddle
            import paddle.incubate as incubate
