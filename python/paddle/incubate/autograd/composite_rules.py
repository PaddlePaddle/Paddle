# This file contains composite rules of nonbasic operations. There are some notes:
# 1. When define composite rule of some op, you can only use primitive ops defined in primitives.py.
# 2. The name and args of target op must be corresponding with standard description of op in
#    ops.yaml or legacy_ops.yaml.
