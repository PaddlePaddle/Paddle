class PairwiseDistance(Layer):
    r"""
    It computes the pairwise distance between two vectors. The
    distance is calculated by p-oreder norm:

    .. math::

        \Vert x \Vert _p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \vert x_i \vert ^ p \right) ^ {1/p}.

    Parameters:
        p (float, optional): The order of norm. Default: :math:`2.0`.
        epsilon (float, optional): Add small value to avoid division by zero.
            Default: :math:`1e-6`.
        keepdim (bool, optional): Whether to reserve the reduced dimension
            in the output Tensor. The result tensor is one dimension less than
            the result of ``|x-y|`` unless :attr:`keepdim` is True. Default: False.
        name (str, optional): For details, please refer to :ref:`api_guide_Name`.
            Generally, no setting is required. Default: None.

    Shape:
        x: :math:`[N, D]` or :math:`[D]`, where :math:`N` is batch size, :math:`D`
            is the dimension of the data. Available data type is float32, float64.
        y: :math:`[N, D]` or :math:`[D]`, y have the same dtype as x.
        output: The same dtype as input tensor.
            - If :attr:`keepdim` is True, the output shape is :math:`[N, 1]` or :math:`[1]`,
                depending on whether the input has data shaped as :math:`[N, D]`.
            - If :attr:`keepdim` is False, the output shape is :math:`[N]` or :math:`[]`,
                depending on whether the input has data shaped as :math:`[N, D]`.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

            import paddle
            x = paddle.to_tensor([[1., 3.], [3., 5.]], dtype=paddle.float64)
            y = paddle.to_tensor([[5., 6.], [7., 8.]], dtype=paddle.float64)
            dist = paddle.nn.PairwiseDistance()
            distance = dist(x, y)
            print(distance.numpy()) # [5. 5.]
