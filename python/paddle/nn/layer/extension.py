    **Row-convolution operator**

    The row convolution is called lookahead convolution.  This operator was 
    introduced in the following paper for 
    `DeepSpeech2 <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dyogatam/papers/wang+etal.iclrworkshop2016.pdf>`_.

    The main motivation is that a bidirectional RNN, useful in DeepSpeech like 
    speech models, learns representation for a sequence by performing a
    forward and a backward pass through the entire sequence. However, unlike
    unidirectional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs are challenging to deploy in an online
    and low-latency setting. The lookahead convolution incorporates information
    from future subsequences in a computationally efficient manner to improve
    unidirectional recurrent neural networks. The row convolution operator is
    different from the 1D sequence convolution, and is computed as follows:

    Given an input sequence X of length t and input dimension D, and a filter 
    (W) of size context * D.

    More details about row_conv please refer to the design document 
    `<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/2228#issuecomment-303903645>`_ .

    Parameters:
        num_channels (int): input data's feature size.
        future_context_size (int): Future context size. Please note, the shape
            of convolution kernel is [future_context_size + 1, D].
        param_attr (ParamAttr): Attributes of parameters, including
            name, initializer etc. Default: None.
        act (str): Non-linear activation to be applied to output variable. Default: None.
        dtype (str, optional): Data type, it can be "float32". Default: "float32".

    Attributes:
        weight (Parameter): shape [future_context_size + 1, D], the learnable 
            weight (convolution kernel) of this layer.

    Returns:
        None
