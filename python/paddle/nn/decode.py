    Decoder is the base class for any decoder instance used in `dynamic_decode`.
    It provides interface for output generation for one time step, which can be
    used to generate sequences.

    The key abstraction provided by Decoder is:

    1. :code:`(initial_input, initial_state, finished) = initialize(inits)` ,
    which generates the input and state for the first decoding step, and gives the
    initial status telling whether each sequence in the batch is finished.
    It would be called once before the decoding iterations.

    2. :code:`(output, next_state, next_input, finished) = step(time, input, state)` ,
    which transforms the input and state to the output and new state, generates
    input for the next decoding step, and emits the flag indicating finished status.
    It is the main part for each decoding iteration.

    3. :code:`(final_outputs, final_state) = finalize(outputs, final_state, sequence_lengths)` ,
    which revises the outputs(stack of all time steps' output) and final state(state from the
    last decoding step) to get the counterpart for special usage.
    Not necessary to be implemented if no need to revise the stacked outputs and
    state from the last decoding step. If implemented, it would be called after
    the decoding iterations.

    Decoder is more general compared to RNNCell, since the returned `next_input`
    and `finished` make it can determine the input and when to finish by itself
    when used in dynamic decoding. Decoder always wraps a RNNCell instance though
    not necessary.

class BeamSearchDecoder(Decoder):
    """
    Decoder with beam search decoding strategy. It wraps a cell to get probabilities,
    and follows a beam search step to calculate scores and select candidate
    token ids for each decoding step.

    Please refer to `Beam search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search>`_
    for more details.

    Note:
        When decoding with beam search, the `inputs` and `states` of cell
        would be tiled to `beam_size` (unsqueeze and tile), resulting to shapes like
        `[batch_size * beam_size, ...]` , which is built into `BeamSearchDecoder` and
        done automatically. Thus any other tensor with shape `[batch_size, ...]` used
        in `cell.call` needs to be tiled manually first, which can be completed by using
        :code:`BeamSearchDecoder.tile_beam_merge_with_batch` . The most common case
        for this is the encoder output in attention mechanism.

    Parameters:
        cell (RNNCellBase): An instance of `RNNCellBase` or object with the same interface.
        start_token (int): The start token id.
        end_token (int): The end token id.
        beam_size (int): The beam width used in beam search.
        embedding_fn (optional): A callable to apply to selected candidate ids.
            Mostly it is an embedding layer to transform ids to embeddings,
            and the returned value acts as the `input` argument for `cell.call`.
            If not provided, the id to embedding transformation must be built into
            `cell.call`. Default None.
        output_fn (optional): A callable to apply to the cell's output prior to
            calculate scores and select candidate token ids. Default None.

    Returns:
        BeamSearchDecoder: An instance of decoder which can be used in \
            `paddle.nn.dynamic_decode` to implement decoding.

    r"""
    Dynamic decoding performs :code:`decoder.step()` repeatedly until the returned
    Tensor indicating finished status contains all True values or the number of
    decoding step reaches to :attr:`max_step_num`.

    :code:`decoder.initialize()` would be called once before the decoding loop.
    If the `decoder` has implemented `finalize` method, :code:`decoder.finalize()`
    would be called once after the decoding loop.

    Parameters:
        decoder(Decoder): An instance of `Decoder`.
        inits(object, optional): Argument passed to `decoder.initialize`.
            Default `None`.
        max_step_num(int, optional): The maximum number of steps. If not provided,
            decode until the decoder is fully done, or in other words, the returned
            Tensor by :code:`decoder.step()` indicating finished status contains
            all True. Default `None`.
        output_time_major(bool, optional): Indicate the data layout of Tensor included
            in the final outputs(the first returned value of this method). If
            attr:`False`, the data layout would be batch major with shape
            `[batch_size, seq_len, ...]`.  If attr:`True`, the data layout would
            be time major with shape `[seq_len, batch_size, ...]`. Default: `False`.
        impute_finished(bool, optional): If `True` and `decoder.tracks_own_finished`
            is False, then states get copied through for batch entries which are
            marked as finished, which differs with the unfinished using the new states
            returned by :code:`decoder.step()` and ensures that the final states have
            the correct values. Otherwise, states wouldn't be copied through when
            finished. If the returned `final_states` is needed, it should be set as
            True, which causes some slowdown. Default `False`.
        is_test(bool, optional): A flag indicating whether to use test mode. In
            test mode, it is more memory saving. Default `False`.
        return_length(bool, optional):  A flag indicating whether to return an
            extra Tensor variable in the output tuple, which stores the actual
            lengths of all decoded sequences. Default `False`.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments. Arguments passed to `decoder.step`.

    Returns:

        - final_outputs (Tensor, nested structure of Tensor), each Tensor in :code:`final_outputs` is the stacked of all decoding steps' outputs, which might be revised
            by :code:`decoder.finalize()` if the decoder has implemented finalize.
            And :code:`final_outputs` has the same structure and data types as the :code:`outputs`
            returned by :code:`decoder.step()`
        - final_states (Tensor, nested structure of Tensor), :code:`final_states` is the counterpart at last time step of initial states \
            returned by :code:`decoder.initialize()` , thus has the same structure
            with it and has tensors with same shapes and data types.
        - sequence_lengths (Tensor), stores the actual lengths of all decoded sequences.
            sequence_lengths is provided only if :code:`return_length` is True.
