class Decoder:
    """
        :api_attr: Static Graph

    Decoder is the base class for any decoder instance used in `dynamic_decode`.
    It provides interface for output generation for one time step, which can be
    used to generate sequences.

    The key abstraction provided by Decoder is:

    1. :code:`(initial_input, initial_state, finished) = initialize(inits)` ,
    which generates the input and state for the first decoding step, and gives the
    initial status telling whether each sequence in the batch is finished.
    It would be called once before the decoding iterations.

    2. :code:`(output, next_state, next_input, finished) = step(time, input, state)` ,
    which transforms the input and state to the output and new state, generates
    input for the next decoding step, and emits the flag indicating finished status.
    It is the main part for each decoding iteration.

    3. :code:`(final_outputs, final_state) = finalize(outputs, final_state, sequence_lengths)` ,
    which revises the outputs(stack of all time steps' output) and final state(state from the
    last decoding step) to get the counterpart for special usage.
    Not necessary to be implemented if no need to revise the stacked outputs and
    state from the last decoding step. If implemented, it would be called after
    the decoding iterations.

    Decoder is more general compared to RNNCell, since the returned `next_input`
    and `finished` make it can determine the input and when to finish by itself
    when used in dynamic decoding. Decoder always wraps a RNNCell instance though
    not necessary.

    Please refer to `Beam search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search>`_
    for more details.

    **NOTE** When decoding with beam search, the `inputs` and `states` of cell
    would be tiled to `beam_size` (unsqueeze and tile), resulting to shapes like
    `[batch_size * beam_size, ...]` , which is built into `BeamSearchDecoder` and
    done automatically. Thus any other tensor with shape `[batch_size, ...]` used
    in `cell.call` needs to be tiled manually first, which can be completed by using
    :code:`BeamSearchDecoder.tile_beam_merge_with_batch` . The most common case
    for this is the encoder output in attention mechanism.

                It has the same structure, shape and data type as the `cell_states` of

                It is same as the `initial_states` returned by `initialize()` for

                `step()` for the others.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple( :code:`(beam_search_output, beam_search_state)` ). \
