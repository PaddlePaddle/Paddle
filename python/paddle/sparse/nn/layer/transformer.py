    Multi-Head Attention performs multiple parallel attention to jointly attending
    to information from different representation subspaces.

    Please refer to `Attention Is All You Need <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf>`_
    for more details.

    Parameters:
        embed_dim (int): The expected feature size in the input and output.
        num_heads (int): The number of heads in multi-head attention.
        dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used on attention
            weights to drop some attention targets. 0 for no dropout. Default 0
        kdim (int, optional): The feature size in key. If None, assumed equal to
            `embed_dim`. Default None.
        vdim (int, optional): The feature size in value. If None, assumed equal to
            `embed_dim`. Default None.
        need_weights (bool, optional): Indicate whether to return the attention
            weights. Default False.
        weight_attr(ParamAttr, optional):  To specify the weight parameter property.
            Default: None, which means the default weight parameter property is used.
            See usage for details in :code:`ParamAttr` .
        bias_attr (ParamAttr|bool, optional): To specify the bias parameter property.
            Default: None, which means the default bias parameter property is used.

        Applies multi-head attention to map queries and a set of key-value pairs
        to outputs.

        Parameters:
            query (Tensor): The queries for multi-head attention. It is a
                tensor with shape `[batch_size, query_length, embed_dim]`. The
                data type should be float32 or float64.
            key (Tensor, optional): The keys for multi-head attention. It is
                a tensor with shape `[batch_size, key_length, kdim]`. The
                data type should be float32 or float64. If None, use `query` as
                `key`. Default None.
            value (Tensor, optional): The values for multi-head attention. It
                is a tensor with shape `[batch_size, value_length, vdim]`.
                The data type should be float32 or float64. If None, use `query` as
                `value`. Default None.
            attn_mask (Tensor, optional): A tensor used in multi-head attention
                to prevents attention to some unwanted positions, usually the
                paddings or the subsequent positions. It is a tensor with shape
                broadcasted to `[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]`.
                When the data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False`
                values and the others have `True` values. When the data type is
                int, the unwanted positions have 0 values and the others have 1
                values. When the data type is float, the unwanted positions have
                `-INF` values and the others have 0 values. It can be None when
                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
            cache (MultiHeadAttention.Cache|MultiHeadAttention.StaticCache, optional):
                It is a namedtuple with `k` and `v` as fields, and stores tensors
                shaped `[batch_size, num_heads, length, embed_dim]` which are results
                of linear projection, reshape and transpose calculations in
                MultiHeadAttention. If it is an instance of `Cache`, `k` and `v`
                fields reserve intermediate results of previous positions, which
                mostly used for decoder self attention. If it is an instance of
                `StaticCache`, `key` and `value` args would be ignored, `k` and
                `v` fields would be used as calculated results on `key` and
                `value`, which mostly used for decoder-encoder cross attention.
                It is only used for inference and should be None for training.
                Default None.

        Returns:
            Tensor|tuple: It is a tensor that has the same shape and data type \
                as `query`, representing attention output. Or a tuple if \
                `need_weights` is True or `cache` is not None. If `need_weights` \
                is True, except for attention output, the tuple also includes \
                the attention weights tensor shaped `[batch_size, num_heads, query_length, key_length]`. \
                If `cache` is not None, the tuple then includes the new cache \
                having the same type as `cache`, and if it is `StaticCache`, it \
                is same as the input `cache`, if it is `Cache`, the new cache \
                reserves tensors concatanating raw tensors with intermediate \

            according to the configurations of it.
        num_layers (int): The number of decoder layers to be stacked.

class Transformer(paddle.nn.Transformer):
    """
    A Transformer model composed of an instance of `TransformerEncoder` and an
    instance of `TransformerDecoder`. While the embedding layer and output layer
    are not included.

    Please refer to `Attention is all you need <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf>`_ ,
    and see `TransformerEncoder` and `TransformerDecoder` for more details.

    Users can configurate the model architecture with corresponding parameters.
    Note the usage of `normalize_before` representing where to apply layer
    normalization (in pre-process or post-precess of multi-head attention or FFN),
    and some transformer like models are different on this, such as
    `BERT <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>`_ and `GPT2 <https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf>`_ .
    The default architecture here places layer normalization in post-process and
    applies another layer normalization on the output of last encoder/decoder layer.

    Parameters:
        d_model (int, optional): The expected feature size in the encoder/decoder input
            and output. Default 512
        nhead (int, optional): The number of heads in multi-head attention(MHA). Default 8
        num_encoder_layers (int, optional): The number of layers in encoder. Default 6
        num_decoder_layers (int, optional): The number of layers in decoder. Default 6
        dim_feedforward (int, optional): The hidden layer size in the feedforward network(FFN). Default 2048
        dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used in pre-process
            and post-precess of MHA and FFN sub-layer. Default 0.1
        activation (str, optional): The activation function in the feedforward
            network. Default relu.
        attn_dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used
            in MHA to drop some attention target. If None, use the value of
            `dropout`. Default None
        act_dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used after FFN
            activition.  If None, use the value of `dropout`. Default None
        normalize_before (bool, optional): Indicate whether to put layer normalization
            into preprocessing of MHA and FFN sub-layers. If True, pre-process is layer
            normalization and post-precess includes dropout, residual connection.
            Otherwise, no pre-process and post-precess includes dropout, residual
            connection, layer normalization. Default False
        weight_attr(ParamAttr|list|tuple, optional): To specify the weight parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, the length of `weight_attr` could be 1, 2 or 3. If it is 3,
            `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` for self attention, `weight_attr[1]`
            would be used as `weight_attr` for cross attention of `TransformerDecoder`,
            and `weight_attr[2]` would be used as `weight_attr` for linear in FFN.
            If it is 2, `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` both for self attention
            and cross attntion and `weight_attr[1]` would be used as `weight_attr` for
            linear in FFN. If it is 1, `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr`
            for self attention, cross attention and linear in FFN. Otherwise,
            the three sub-layers all uses it as `weight_attr` to create parameters.
            Default: None, which means the default weight parameter property is used.
            See usage for details
            in :code:`ParamAttr` .
        bias_attr (ParamAttr|list|tuple|bool, optional): To specify the bias parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, the length of `bias_attr` could be 1, 2 or 3. If it is 3,
            `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr` for self attention, `bias_attr[1]`
            would be used as `bias_attr` for cross attention of `TransformerDecoder`,
            and `bias_attr[2]` would be used as `bias_attr` for linear in FFN.
            If it is 2, `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr` both for self attention
            and cross attntion and `bias_attr[1]` would be used as `bias_attr` for
            linear in FFN. If it is 1, `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr`
            for self attention, cross attention and linear in FFN. Otherwise,
            the three sub-layers all uses it as `bias_attr` to create parameters.
            The `False` value means the corresponding layer would not have trainable
            bias parameter. See usage for details in :code:`ParamAttr` .
            Default: None,which means the default bias parameter property is used.
        custom_encoder (Layer, optional): If custom encoder is provided, use it as the encoder.
            Default None
        custom_decoder (Layer, optional): If custom decoder is provided, use it as the decoder.
            Default None
