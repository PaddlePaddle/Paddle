    Reindex Graph API.

    This API is mainly used in Graph Learning domain, which should be used
    in conjunction with `paddle.geometric.sample_neighbors` API. And the main purpose
    is to reindex the ids information of the input nodes, and return the
    corresponding graph edges after reindex.

    Take input nodes x = [0, 1, 2] as an example. If we have neighbors = [8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 7], and count = [2, 3, 2],
    then we know that the neighbors of 0 is [8, 9], the neighbors of 1 is [0, 4, 7], and the neighbors of 2 is [6, 7].
    Then after graph_reindex, we will have 3 different outputs: reindex_src: [3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 6], reindex_dst: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
    and out_nodes: [0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 4, 7, 6]. We can see that the numbers in `reindex_src` and `reindex_dst` is the corresponding index
    of nodes in `out_nodes`.

    Note:
        The number in x should be unique, otherwise it would cause potential errors. We will reindex all the nodes from 0.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): The input nodes which we sample neighbors for. The available
                    data type is int32, int64.
        neighbors (Tensor): The neighbors of the input nodes `x`. The data type
                            should be the same with `x`.
        count (Tensor): The neighbor count of the input nodes `x`. And the
                        data type should be int32.
        value_buffer (Tensor|None): Value buffer for hashtable. The data type should be int32,
                                    and should be filled with -1. Only useful for gpu version.
        index_buffer (Tensor|None): Index buffer for hashtable. The data type should be int32,
                                    and should be filled with -1. Only useful for gpu version.
                                    `value_buffer` and `index_buffer` should be both not None
                                    if you want to speed up by using hashtable buffer.
        name (str, optional): Name for the operation (optional, default is None).
                              For more information, please refer to :ref:`api_guide_Name`.

    Returns:
        - reindex_src (Tensor), the source node index of graph edges after reindex.

        - reindex_dst (Tensor), the destination node index of graph edges after reindex.

        - out_nodes (Tensor), the index of unique input nodes and neighbors before reindex, where we put the input nodes `x` in the front, and put neighbor nodes in the back.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

            import paddle
            x = [0, 1, 2]
            neighbors = [8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 7]

            x = paddle.to_tensor(x, dtype="int64")
            neighbors = paddle.to_tensor(neighbors, dtype="int64")
            count = paddle.to_tensor(count, dtype="int32")
