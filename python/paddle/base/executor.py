    This function switches scope through python `with` statement.
    Scope records the mapping between variable names and variables ( :ref:`api_guide_Variable` ),

    If this function is not invoked, all variables and variable names are recorded in the default global scope.
    When users need to create variables with the same name,
    they need to switch scopes through this function
    if they do not want the mapping of variables with the same name to be overwritten.
    After switching through the `with` statement,

class Executor:
    """
    :api_attr: Static Graph

    An Executor in Python, supports single/multiple-GPU running,
    and single/multiple-CPU running.

    Args:
        place(paddle.CPUPlace()|paddle.CUDAPlace(n)|str|None): This parameter represents
            which device the executor runs on. When this parameter is None, PaddlePaddle
            will set the default device according to its installation version. If Paddle
            is CPU version, the default device would be set to `CPUPlace()` . If Paddle is
            GPU version, the default device would be set to `CUDAPlace(0)` . Default is None.
            If ``place`` is string, it can be ``cpu``, and ``gpu:x``, where ``x``
            is the index of the GPUs. Note: users only pass one Place or None to initialize
            Executor when using multiple-cards. Other APIs will override the cards. See
            `document for multiple-cards <https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/develop/guides/01_paddle2.0_introduction/update_en.html#stand-alone-multi-card-launch>`_

        is not set, the executor will use the global scope, i.e. :code:`paddle.static.global_scope()`.

        Args:
            program(Program|CompiledProgram): This parameter represents the :code:`Program` or
                :code:`CompiledProgram` to be executed. If this parameter is not provided, that
                parameter is None, the program will be set to :code:`paddle.static.default_main_program()`.
                The default is None.
            feed(list|dict): This parameter represents the input Tensors of the model.
                If it is single card training, the feed is dict type, and if it is multi-card
                training, the parameter feed can be dict or list of Tensors. If the
                parameter type is dict, the data in the feed will be split and sent to
                multiple devices (CPU/GPU), that is to say, the input data will be evenly
                sent to different devices, so you should make sure the number of samples of
                the current mini-batch must be greater than the number of places;
                if the parameter type is list, those data are copied directly to each device,
                so the length of this list should be equal to the number of places.
                The default is None.
            fetch_list(list): This parameter represents the Tensors that need to be returned
                after the model runs. The default is None.
            feed_var_name(str): This parameter represents the name of the input Tensor of
                the feed operator. The default is "feed".
            fetch_var_name(str): This parameter represents the name of the output Tensor of
                the fetch operator. The default is "fetch".
            scope(Scope): the scope used to run this program, you can switch
                it to different scope. default is :code:`paddle.static.global_scope()`
            return_numpy(bool): This parameter indicates whether convert the fetched Tensors

                the type of the return value is a list of :code:`DenseTensor`. The default is True.
            use_program_cache(bool): This parameter indicates whether the input :code:`Program` is cached.
                If the parameter is True, the model may run faster in the following cases:
                the input program is :code:`paddle.static.Program`, and the parameters(program, feed Tensor name
                and fetch_list Tensor) of this interface remains unchanged during running.
                The default is False.
            use_prune(bool): This parameter indicates whether the input :code:`Program` will be pruned.
                If the parameter is True, the program will be pruned according to the given feed and fetch_list,
                which means the operators and variables in program that generate :code:`feed` and are not
                needed to generate :code:`fetch_list` will be pruned. The default is False, which means the
                program will not pruned and all the operators and variables will be executed during running.
                Note that if the tuple returned from :code:`Optimizer.minimize()` is passed to :code:`fetch_list`,
                :code:`use_prune` will be overridden to True, and the program will be pruned.

        Infer from a pre-defined Dataset. Dataset is defined in paddle.base.dataset.
        Given a program, either a program or compiled program, infer_from_dataset will
        consume all data samples in dataset. Input scope can be given by users. By default,
        scope is global_scope(). The total number of thread run in training is `thread`.
        Thread number used in training will be minimum value of threadnum in Dataset and
        the value of thread in this interface. Debug can be set so that executor will display
        Run-Time for all operators and the throughputs of current infer task.

        The document of infer_from_dataset is almost the same as train_from_dataset,
        except that in distributed training, push gradients will be disabled in infer_from_dataset.
        infer_from_dataset() can be used for evaluation in multi-threadvery easily.

        Args:
            program(Program|CompiledProgram): the program that needs to be run,
                if not provided, then default_main_program (not compiled) will be used.
            dataset(paddle.base.Dataset): dataset created outside this function,
                a user should provide a well-defined dataset before calling this function.
                Please check the document of Dataset if needed. default is None
            scope(Scope): the scope used to run this program, you can switch it to different scope
                for each run. default is global_scope
            thread(int): number of thread a user wants to run in this function. Default is 0, which
                means using thread num of dataset
            debug(bool): whether a user wants to run infer_from_dataset, default is False
            fetch_list(Tensor List): fetch Tensor list, each Tensor will be printed during
                training, default is None
            fetch_info(String List): print information for each Tensor, default is None
            print_period(int): the number of mini-batches for each print, default is 100
            fetch_handler(FetchHandler): a user define class for fetch output.

        scope is global_scope(). The total number of thread run in training is `thread`.
        Thread number used in training will be minimum value of threadnum in Dataset and
        the value of thread in this interface. Debug can be set so that executor will display
        Run-Time for all operators and the throughputs of current training task.

        Note: train_from_dataset will destroy all resources created within executor for each run.

        Args:
            program(Program|CompiledProgram): the program that needs to be run,
                if not provided, then default_main_program (not compiled) will be used.
            dataset(paddle.base.Dataset): dataset created outside this function,
                a user should provide a well-defined dataset before calling this function.
                Please check the document of Dataset if needed.
            scope(Scope): the scope used to run this program, you can switch it to different scope
                for each run. default is global_scope
            thread(int): number of thread a user wants to run in this function. Default is 0, which
                means using thread num of dataset
            debug(bool): whether a user wants to run train_from_dataset
            fetch_list(Tensor List): fetch Tensor list, each variable will be printed
                during training
            fetch_info(String List): print information for each Tensor, its length should be equal
                to fetch_list
            print_period(int): the number of mini-batches for each print, default is 100
            fetch_handler(FetchHandler): a user define class for fetch output.

        Returns:
            None

        Examples:
