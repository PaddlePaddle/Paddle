# It would be too lengthy to require our users to prefix decorators with `decorator`.
# For example, we want the following line
#
#     r = paddle.reader.decorator.bufferd(paddle.reader.creator.text("hello.txt"))
#
# to be a shorter version:
#
#     r = paddle.reader.buffered(paddle.reader.creator.text("hello.txt"))
