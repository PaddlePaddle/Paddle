def all_reduce(tensor, op=ReduceOp.SUM, group=None, sync_op=True):
    """

    Reduce a tensor over all ranks so that all get the result.
    As shown below, one process is started with a GPU and the data of this process is represented
    by its group rank. The reduce operator is sum. Through all_reduce operator,
    each GPU will have the sum of the data from all GPUs.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): The input Tensor. It also works as the output Tensor. Its data type
            should be float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8 or bool.
        op (ReduceOp.SUM|ReduceOp.MAX|ReduceOp.MIN|ReduceOp.PROD|ReduceOp.AVG, optional): The operation used. Default value is ReduceOp.SUM.
        group (Group, optional): The group instance return by new_group or None for global default group.
        sync_op (bool, optional): Wether this op is a sync op. Default value is True.

    Returns:
        Return a task object.

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python
