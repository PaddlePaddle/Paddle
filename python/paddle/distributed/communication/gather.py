def gather(tensor, gather_list=None, dst=0, group=None, sync_op=True):
    """

    Gather tensors from all participators.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): The input Tensor. Its data type
            should be float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8, bool or bfloat16.
        gather_list (list): A list of Tensors to hold the gathered tensors. Every element in the list must be a Tensor whose data type
            should be float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8, bool or bfloat16. Default value is None.
        dst (int): The dst rank id. Default value is 0.
        group (Group, optional): The group instance return by new_group or None for global default group.
        sync_op (bool, optional): Whether this op is a sync op. The default value is True.

    Returns:
        Async work handle,which can be wait on, if async_op is set to True.
        None, if not async_op

    Examples:
        .. code-block:: python

            # required: distributed
            import paddle
            import paddle.distributed as dist
