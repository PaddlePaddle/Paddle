    Send a tensor to the destination device.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): The tensor to send. Support float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8 or bool as its data type.
        dst (int, optional): Rank of the destination device. If none is given, use `0` as default.
        group (Group, optional): Communicate in which group. If none is given, use the global group as default.
        sync_op (bool, optional): Indicate whether the communication is sync or not. If none is given, use true as default.
        use_calc_stream (bool, optional): Indicate whether the communication is done on calculation stream. If none is given, use false as default. This
            option is designed for high performance demand, be careful to turn it on except you are clearly know its meaning.

    Returns:
        Return a task object.

    Warning:
        This API only supports the dygraph mode now.
