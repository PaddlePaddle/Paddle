def all_gather(tensor_list, tensor, group=None, sync_op=True):
    """

    Gather tensors from all participators and all get the result. As shown
    below, one process is started with a GPU and the data of this process is represented
    by its group rank. Through the all_gather operator, each GPU will have data
    from all GPUs.

    Args:
        tensor_list (list): A list of output Tensors. Every element in the list must be a Tensor whose data type
            should be float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8, bool or bfloat16.
        tensor (Tensor): The Tensor to send. Its data type
            should be float16, float32, float64, int32, int64, int8, uint8, bool or bfloat16.
        group (Group, optional): The group instance return by new_group or None for global default group.
        sync_op (bool, optional): Whether this op is a sync op. The default value is True.

    Returns:
        None.

        .. code-block:: python

def all_gather_object(object_list, obj, group=None):
    """

    Gather picklable objects from all participators and all get the result. Similiar to all_gather(), but python object can be passed in.

    Args:
        object_list (list): A list of output object. The datatype of every element in the list is same as the input obj.
        obj (Any): The picklable object to send.
        group (Group): The group instance return by new_group or None for global default group.

    Returns:
        None.

        This API only supports the dygraph mode.
