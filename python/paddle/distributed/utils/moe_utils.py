def global_scatter(
    x, local_count, global_count, group=None, use_calc_stream=True
):
    """
    The global_scatter operator distributes the data of x to n_expert * world_size experts according to local_count,
    and then receives data according to global_count. The expert refers to a user-defined expert network,
    n_expert refers to the number of expert networks owned by each card, and world_size refers to the number of graphics cards running the network.

    As shown below, the value of the world size is 2, n_expert 2, the batch size of the x 4 and local_count is [2, 0, 2, 0].
    The global_count of the rank 0 is [2, 0, , ], rank 1 is [2, 0, ,](Due to the limited space, only the data calculated on rank 0 is shown here).
    In the global_scatter operator, local_count[i] represents sending local_count[i] data to the (i % n_expert)th expert of the (i // n_expert)th card,
    global_count[i] represents receiving global_count[i] data from the (i // n_expert)th card to the (i % n_expert)th expert of this card. The rank in the
    figure represent the rank of the current card in all cards.

    The process of global_scatter sending data is as follows:

    local_count[0] represents taking out 2 batches from x and sending 2 batches to the 0th expert of the 0th card;

    local_count[1] represents taking out 0 batches from x and sending 0 batches to the 1st expert of the 0th card;

    local_count[2] represents taking out 2 batches from x and sending 2 batches to the 0th expert of the 1st card;

    local_count[3] represents taking out 0 batches from x and sending 0 batches to the 1st expert of the 1st card;

    Therefore, the global_count[0] of the 0th card is equal to 2, which means that 2 batches of data are received from the 0th card to the 0th expert;

    the global_count[1] of the 0th card is equal to 0, which means that 0 batches of data are received from the 0th card to the 1st expert;

    the global_count[0] of the 1st card is equal to 2, which means that 2 batches of data are received from the 0th card to the 0th expert;

    the global_count[1] of the 1st card is equal to 0, which means that 0 batches of data are received from the 0th card to the 1st expert.
