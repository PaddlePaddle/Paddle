Paddle for Linux-musl Usage Guide
===========================================

# Introduction
Paddle can be built for linux-musl such as alpine, and be used in libos-liked SGX TEE environment. Currently supported commericial product TEE Scone, and community maintanced TEE Occlum. We also working on to support open source TEE Graphene.


# Build Automatically
1. clone paddle source from github
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle.git
```

2. setup build directory

```bash
# enter paddle directory
cd  ./Paddle

# create and enter building directory
mkdir -p build && cd build
```

3. build docker for compiling. use environment HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY for proxy setup.

```bash
# setup proxy address, when the speed of internet is not good.
# export HTTP_PROXY='http://127.0.0.1:8080'
# export HTTPS_PROXY='https://127.0.0.1:8080'

# invoke build script
../paddle/scripts/musl_build/build_docker.sh
```

4. compile paddle in previous built docker. proxy setup method is same as previous step.


```bash
# setup proxy addresss, when the speed of internet is not good.
# export HTTP_PROXY='http://127.0.0.1:8080'
# export HTTPS_PROXY='https://127.0.0.1:8080'

# invoke build paddle script
# all arguments, such as -j8 optinal, is past to make procedure.
../paddle/scripts/musl_build/build_paddle.sh -j8

# find output wheel package
# output wheel packages will save to "./output" directory.
ls ./output/*.whl
```

# Build Manually  

1. start up the building docker, and enter the shell in the container
```bash
# checkout paddle source code
git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle.git

# entery paddle directory
cd ./Paddle

# build docker image
../paddle/scripts/musl_build/build_docker.sh

# enter the container interactive shell
BUILD_MAN=1 ../paddle/scripts/musl_build/build_paddle.sh
```

2. type commands and compile source manually
```sh
# compile paddle by commands
# paddle is mount to /paddle directory
# working directory is /root
mkdir build && cd build

# install python requirement
pip install -r /paddle/python/requirements.txt

# configure project with cmake
cmake -DWITH_MUSL=ON -DWITH_CRYPTO=OFF -DWITH_MKL=OFF -DWITH_GPU=OFF /paddle

# run the make to build project.
# the argument -j8 is optional to accelerate compiling.
make -j8
```

# Scripts
1. **build_docker.sh**
   compiling docker building script. it use alpine linux 3.10 as musl linux build enironment. it will try to install all the compiling tools, development packages, and python requirements for paddle musl compiling.
    
    environment variables:

   - WITH_PRUNE_DAYS: prune old docker images, with days limitation.
   - WITH_REBUILD: force to rebuild the image, default=0.
   - WITH_REQUIREMENT: build with the python requirements, default=1.
   - WITH_UT_REQUIREMENT: build with the unit test requirements, default=0.
   - WITH_PIP_INDEX: use custom pip index when pip install packages.
   - ONLY_NAME: only print the docker name, and exit.
   - HTTP_PROXY: use http proxy.
   - HTTPS_PROXY: use https proxy.

2. **build_paddle.sh** automatically or manually paddle building script. it will mount the root directory of paddle source to /paddle, and run compile procedure in /root/build directory. the output wheel package will save to the ./output directory relative to working directory.
    
    environment variables:

    - BUILD_MAN: build the paddle manually, default=0.
    - WITH_TEST: build with unitest, and run unitest check, default=0.
    - WITH_PRUNE_CONTAINER: remove the container after building, default=0.
    - HTTP_PROXY: use http proxy.
    - HTTPS_PROXY: use https proxy.
