  This runner only supports:
  T in {half, __nv_bfloat} WeightType in {uint8_t, cutlass::uint4b_t}

  Activations, biases, scales and outputs are all assumed to be row-major.

  However, it is assumed that B is in a special format governed by
  cutlass_extensions/gemm/kernel/mixed_gemm_B_layout. In this case, B must be
  preprocessed using the cutlass weight only quant preprocessors. The weight
  preprocessor will instantiate the layout and preprocess based on the
  instantiation, so layout changes should only require modifications to
  mix_gemm_B_layout.h.
