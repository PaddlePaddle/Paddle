 *              allocated in the same memory space as probs and memory
 *              ordering is identical.
 * \param [in]  flat_labels Always in CPU memory.  A concatenation
 *              of all the labels for the minibatch (should be padded to same
 * length) \param [in]  label_lengths Always in CPU memory. The length of each
 * label for each example in the minibatch. \param [in]  input_lengths Always in
 * CPU memory.  The number of time steps for each sequence in the minibatch.
 * \param [in]  alphabet_size The number of possible output symbols.  There
 *              should be this many probabilities for each time step.
 * \param [in]  mini_batch How many examples in a minibatch.
 * \param [in]  maxT maximum length along time dimension.
 * \param [in]  maxU maximum length along prediction dimention.
 * \param [out] costs Always in CPU memory.  The cost of each example in the
 *              minibatch.
