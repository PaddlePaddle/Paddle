/**
 * @brief Return a partial view of input with the its diagonal elements
 *        of the input tensor. The behavior of this operator is similar to
 *        how `numpy.diagonal` works.
 * @param  ctx     device context
 * @param  x       the input tensor, from which the diagonals are taken
 * @param  offset  offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be both
 *                 positive and negative
 * @param  axis1   the first axis of the 2-D planes from which the diagonals
 *                 should be taken. Can be either positive or negative
 * @param  axis2   the second axis of the 2-D planes from which the diagonals
 *                 should be taken. Can be either positive or negative
 * @param  out     the partial view of input with the its diagonal elements
