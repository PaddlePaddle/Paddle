/**
 * @brief Construct a Tensor from a buffer pointed to by `data`
 *
 * @note `from_blob` doesnâ€™t copy or move data, Modifying the constructed tensor
 *       is equivalent to modifying the original data.
 *
 * @param data The pointer to the memory buffer.
 * @param shape The dims of the tensor.
 * @param dtype The data type of the tensor, should correspond to data type of
 *              `data`. See PD_FOR_EACH_DATA_TYPE in `phi/common/data_type.h`
 * @param layout The data layout of the tensor.
 * @param place The place where the tensor is located.
 *              If `place` is default value, it will be inferred from `data`,
 *              However, the feature is only supported on CPU or GPU.
 *              If `place` is not default value, make sure that `place` is equal
 *              to the place of `data`
 * @param deleter A function or function object that will be called to free the
 *                memory buffer.
 *
 * @return A Tensor object constructed from the buffer
