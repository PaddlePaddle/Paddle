/**
 * @brief Context projection concatenate features in adjacent time steps in
 * a sequence. The i-th row of the output is the concatenation of
 * context_length rows of the input. The context_length rows are the
 * consecutive rows from the i+shift_start row.
 *
 * For example, assumed input (x) has 4 words and the dimension of each word
 * representation is 2. If we use zero to pad instead of learned weight to pad,
 * and the context_lenth is 3, the output (y) is:
 *
 * @code
 *  x = [a1, a2;
 *       b1, b2;
 *       c1, c2;
 *       d1, d2]
 *  y = [0,  0,  a1, a2, b1, b2;
 *       a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2;
 *       b1, b2, c1, c2, d1, d2;
 *       c1, c2, d1, d2, 0,  0]
 * @endcode
 *
 * The config file api is context_projection.
