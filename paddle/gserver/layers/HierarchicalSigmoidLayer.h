/**
 * Organize the classes into a binary tree. At each node, a sigmoid function
 * is used to calculate the probability of belonging to the right branch.
 * This idea is from "F. Morin, Y. Bengio (AISTATS 05):
 * Hierarchical Probabilistic Neural Network Language Model."
 *
 * Here we uses a simple way of making the binary tree.
 * Assuming the number of classes C = 6,
 * The classes are organized as a binary tree in the following way:
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * *-*-*- 2
 * | | |- 3
 * | |
 * | |-*- 4
 * |   |- 5
 * |
 * |-*- 0
 * |- 1
 * @endcode
 *
 * where * indicates an internal node, and each leaf node represents a class.
 * - Node 0 ... C-2 are internal nodes.
 * - Node C-1 ... 2C-2 are leaf nodes.
 * - Class c is represented by leaf node \f$c+C-1\f$.
 *
 * We assign an id for each node:
 * - the id of root be 0.
 * - the left child of a node i is 2*i+1.
 * - the right child of a node i is 2*i+2.
 *
 * It's easy to see that:
 * - the parent of node i is \f$\left\lfloor(i-1)/2\right\rfloor\f$.
 * - the j-th level ancestor of node i is
 * \f$\left\lfloor(i+1)/2^{j+1}\right\rfloor - 1\f$.
 * - A node i is a left child of its parent if \f$(i-1)\%2==0\f$.
 *
 * The config file api is hsigmod_layer.
