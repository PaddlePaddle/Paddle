// In PaddlePaddle, Operator is used to do a certain computation, such
// as "add" "sub" "cosin". To do this, it need to know what is the input
// and output variables, and some ops may have special attributes for
// computing, such as "scale" in "CosinOp".
//
// 3rd-party language can build this proto message and call
// AddOp(const OpDesc& op_desc) of Paddle core to create an Operator.
