Sequence Erase Operator.

Sequence erase operator erases tokens specified by Attr(tokens) from the input 
sequences Input(X), and outputs the remaining data and modifies the LoD 
information at the same time. For example, given a 2-D LoDTensor

    X = [[2, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9, 6, 1, 0, 1]]^T

with lod = [[0, 3, 6, 10]], there are three sequences in the input:
   
     X1 = [[2, 2, 6]]^T, X2 = [[1, 3, 9]]^T and X3 = [[6, 1, 0, 1]]^T.

If the tokens to be erased are Attr(tokens) = [2, 3, 5], after the erasing 
operation, the three sequences become

    X1' = [[6]]^T, X2' = [[1, 9]]^T and X3' = [[6, 1, 0, 1]]^T.

Hence the LoDTensor Output(Out) should be

    Out = [[6, 1, 9, 6, 1, 0, 1]]^T,

with lod = [[0, 1, 3, 7]].

An example usage for this operator is to remove the special tokens when 
computing the edit distance between two strings, such as blank, start token, 
and end token.
