EditDistance operator computes the edit distances between a batch of hypothesis
strings and their references.

Edit distance, also called Levenshtein distance, measures how dissimilar two strings
are by counting the minimum number of operations to transform one string into another.
The operations include insertion, deletion, and substitution. 

For example, given hypothesis string A = "kitten" and reference B = "sitting",
A will be transformed into B at least after two substitutions and one
insertion:

   "kitten" -> "sitten" -> "sittin" -> "sitting"

So the edit distance between A and B is 3.

Input(Hyps) is a 2-D Tensor or a 2-D LoDTensor consisting of all the hypothesis strings.
And the `batch_size` reference strings are arranged in order in the same way in the
Input(Refs).

Output(Out) contains the `batch_size` results and each stands for the edit distance
for a pair of strings respectively. If Attr(normalized) is true, the edit distance
will be divided by the length of reference string.
