This operator does multi-class matrix non maximum suppression (NMS) on batched
boxes and scores.
In the NMS step, this operator greedily selects a subset of detection bounding
boxes that have high scores larger than score_threshold, if providing this
threshold, then selects the largest nms_top_k confidences scores if nms_top_k
is larger than -1. Then this operator decays boxes score according to the
Matrix NMS scheme.
Aftern NMS step, at most keep_top_k number of total bboxes are to be kept
per image if keep_top_k is larger than -1.
This operator support multi-class and batched inputs. It applying NMS
independently for each class. The outputs is a 2-D LoDTenosr, for each
image, the offsets in first dimension of LoDTensor are called LoD, the number
of offset is N + 1, where N is the batch size. If LoD[i + 1] - LoD[i] == 0,
means there is no detected bbox for this image. Now this operator has one more
output, which is RoisNum. The size of RoisNum is N, RoisNum[i] means the number of 
detected bbox for this image.
