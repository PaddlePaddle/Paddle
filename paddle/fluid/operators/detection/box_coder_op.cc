Bounding Box Coder.

Encode/Decode the target bounding box with the priorbox information.

The Encoding schema described below:

    ox = (tx - px) / pw / pxv

    oy = (ty - py) / ph / pyv

    ow = log(abs(tw / pw)) / pwv 

    oh = log(abs(th / ph)) / phv 

The Decoding schema described below:

    ox = (pw * pxv * tx * + px) - tw / 2

    oy = (ph * pyv * ty * + py) - th / 2

    ow = exp(pwv * tw) * pw + tw / 2

    oh = exp(phv * th) * ph + th / 2

where `tx`, `ty`, `tw`, `th` denote the target box's center coordinates, width
and height respectively. Similarly, `px`, `py`, `pw`, `ph` denote the
priorbox's (anchor) center coordinates, width and height. `pxv`, `pyv`, `pwv`,
`phv` denote the variance of the priorbox and `ox`, `oy`, `ow`, `oh` denote the
encoded/decoded coordinates, width and height. 

During Box Decoding, two modes for broadcast are supported. Say target box has 
shape [N, M, 4], and the shape of prior box can be [N, 4] or [M, 4]. Then prior
box will broadcast to target box along the assigned axis.
