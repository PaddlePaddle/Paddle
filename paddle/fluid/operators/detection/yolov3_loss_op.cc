         This operator generates yolov3 loss based on given predict result and ground
         truth boxes.
         
         The output of previous network is in shape [N, C, H, W], while H and W
         should be the same, H and W specify the grid size, each grid point predict 
         given number bounding boxes, this given number, which following will be represented as S,
         is specified by the number of anchor clusters in each scale. In the second dimension(the channel
         dimension), C should be equal to S * (class_num + 5), class_num is the object 
         category number of source dataset(such as 80 in coco dataset), so in the 
         second(channel) dimension, apart from 4 box location coordinates x, y, w, h, 
         also includes confidence score of the box and class one-hot key of each anchor box.

         Assume the 4 location coordinates are :math:`t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h`, the box predictions
         should be as follows:

         $$
         b_x = \\sigma(t_x) + c_x
         $$
         $$
         b_y = \\sigma(t_y) + c_y
         $$
         $$
         b_w = p_w e^{t_w}
         $$
         $$
         b_h = p_h e^{t_h}
         $$

         In the equation above, :math:`c_x, c_y` is the left top corner of current grid
         and :math:`p_w, p_h` is specified by anchors.

         As for confidence score, it is the logistic regression value of IoU between
         anchor boxes and ground truth boxes, the score of the anchor box which has 
         the max IoU should be 1, and if the anchor box has IoU bigger than ignore 
         thresh, the confidence score loss of this anchor box will be ignored.

         Therefore, the yolov3 loss consists of three major parts: box location loss,
         objectness loss and classification loss. The L1 loss is used for 
         box coordinates (w, h), sigmoid cross entropy loss is used for box 
         coordinates (x, y), objectness loss and classification loss.

         Each groud truth box finds a best matching anchor box in all anchors. 
         Prediction of this anchor box will incur all three parts of losses, and
         prediction of anchor boxes with no GT box matched will only incur objectness
         loss.

         In order to trade off box coordinate losses between big boxes and small 
         boxes, box coordinate losses will be mutiplied by scale weight, which is
         calculated as follows.

         $$
         weight_{box} = 2.0 - t_w * t_h
         $$

         Final loss will be represented as follows.

         $$
         loss = (loss_{xy} + loss_{wh}) * weight_{box}
              + loss_{conf} + loss_{class}
         $$

         While :attr:`use_label_smooth` is set to be :attr:`True`, the classification
         target will be smoothed when calculating classification loss, target of 
         positive samples will be smoothed to :math:`1.0 - 1.0 / class\_num` and target of
         negetive samples will be smoothed to :math:`1.0 / class\_num`.

         While :attr:`GTScore` is given, which means the mixup score of ground truth 
         boxes, all losses incured by a ground truth box will be multiplied by its 
         mixup score.
