    AddComment(R"DOC(
The crf_decoding operator reads the emission feature weights and the transition
feature weights learned by the linear_chain_crf operator and performs decoding. 
It implements the Viterbi algorithm which is a dynamic programming algorithm 
for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states, called the Viterbi path, 
that results in a sequence of observed tags.

The output of this operator changes according to whether Input(Label) is given:

1. Input(Label) is given:
   This happens in training. This operator is used to co-work with the chunk_eval
   operator.
   When Input(Label) is given, the crf_decoding operator returns tensor with the 
   sampe shape as Input(Label) whose values are fixed to be 0, indicating an 
   incorrect prediction, or 1 indicating a tag is correctly predicted. Such an 
   output is the input to chunk_eval operator.

2. Input(Label) is not given:
   This is the standard decoding process.

The crf_decoding operator returns a row vector with shape [N x 1]/[B x S], here 
the shape depends on the inputs are LoDTensors or common tensors, whose values
range from 0 to maximum tag number - 1, Each element indicates an index of a
predicted tag.
