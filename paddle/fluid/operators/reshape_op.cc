Reshape Operator.

Reshape Input(X) into the shape specified by Attr(shape) or Input(Shape). The
data in Input(X) are unchanged.

Examples:

1. Given a 3-D tensor Input(X) with a shape [2, 4, 6], and the target shape
specified by Attr(shape) is [6, 8], the reshape operator will transform Input(X)
into a 2-D tensor with shape [6, 8] and leaving Input(X)'s data unchanged.

2. Given a 3-D tensor Input(X) with a shape [2, 4, 6], and the target shape
specified by Attr(shape) is [2, 3, -1, 2], the reshape operator will transform
Input(X) into a 4-D tensor with shape [2, 3, 4, 2] and leaving Input(X)'s data
unchanged. In this case, one and only dimension of Attr(shape) can be set to -1,
the value of this dimension is inferred from the total element number of
Input(X) and remaining dimensions.

3. Given a 3-D tensor Input(X) with a shape [2, 4, 6], and the target shape
specified by Attr(shape) is [-1, 0, 3, 2], the reshape operator will transform
Input(X) into a 4-D tensor with shape [2, 4, 3, 2] and leaving Input(X)'s data
unchanged. In this case, besides -1, 0 means the actual dimension value is going
to be copied from the corresponding dimension of Input(X).

Note:

1. One and only one dimension in Attr(shape) can be set -1. In this case,
the actual dimension value will be infered from the total element number of
Input(X) and remaining dimensions.

2. More than one dimensions in Attr(shape) can be set to 0, which means the real
dimension value will be copied from Input(X) at runtime. Note that the index of
0 can not exceed Rank(X). For example, Input(X) is a 3-D tensor with shape
[2, 3, 4], Attr(shape) = [2, 3, 2, 0] is an invalid input.

3. Input(Shape) has a higher priority than Attr(shape) if it is provided, while
Attr(shape) still should be set correctly to gurantee shape inference in 
compile-time.
