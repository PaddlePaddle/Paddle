// A pass named BuildCinnPass, the function of this pass is:
//
// a) Detect the subgraphs that can be compiled by the CINN compiler. We call a
// detected subgraph a cluster, which is consisted of several op nodes.
//
// b) Call the CINN compiler to compile each original cluster and get the
// compiled cluster, which is consisted of several kCinnLaunchOp.
//
// c) Replace the original cluster with corresponding compiled cluster on the
// original graph.
//
// In this pass, some questions are handled with cautions:
//
// a) How to determine whether two op nodes can be divided into a cluster?
// Firstly, both op nodes should be compile supported.
// Secondly, there should be a direct path between the two op nodes through a
// var node.
// Thirdly, there should be no extra path between the two op nodes through
// unsupported op nodes.
// Lastly, if op nodes a and b can be divied into a cluster, op nodes b and c
// can be divided into a cluster, a and c can also be divided into a cluster.
// The implementation of cluster detection is encapsulated in the
// SubGraphDetector
// class.
//
// b) How to deal with the links between the var nodes in global graph and the
// op nodes in a cluster?
// We first add links between the var nodes in global graph and the op nodes in
// the compiled cluster, and then remove useless links between the var nodes in
// global graph and the op nodes in the original cluster.
