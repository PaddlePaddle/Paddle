/*
 NOTE(liym27): [ What is TensorInplaceVersion used for? ]

 TensorInplaceVersion is a version counter and every Tensor has a version
 counter. It's used to check whether an inplace operation will result in an
 incorrect gradient calculation. Version is incremented when the data of the
 Variable is modified in place.

 - Question: In what scenarios will version counters be shared?
 - Answer: When two Variables/VarBases share the same C++ Tensor(its Allocation
 may change), both of them share the same version counter. For examples:
  1. `z = paddle.assign(input=x, output=y)`, `z` shares the same version counter
    of `y` because z and y is the same VarBase;
  2. `y = x.detach()`, `y` shares the same version counter of `x`.

 - Question: In what scenarios will version counters NOT be shared?
 - Answer: Replacing a `Variable`'s data by calling `Tensor::ShareDataWith(...)`
 or `Tensor::ShareBufferWith(...)`. Because they share the same Allocation but
 not framework::Tensor.

 - Question: Why put the inplace_version_counter_ in framework::Tensor instead
 of Allocation or Variable?
 - Answer:
  1. Tensor can call ResetHolder() to reset the corresponding Allocation so that
  the inplace_version_counter_ changes if it's in Allocation, which will lead to
  confusing information about inplace version.
  2. If inplace_version_counter_ is in Variable, different VariableWrappers
  should be able to share the same Variable. However, a VariableWrapper hold a
  Variable object but not a pointer.
