# Embed Paddle Inference in Your Application

Paddle inference offers the APIs in `C` and `C++` languages.

You can easily deploy a model trained by Paddle following the steps as below:

1. Optimize the native model;
2. Write some codes for deployment.

## The APIs

All the released APIs are located in the `paddle_inference_api.h` header file. 
The stable APIs are wrapped by `namespace paddle`, the unstable APIs are protected by `namespace paddle::contrib`.

## Write some codes

Read `paddle_inference_api.h` for more information.
