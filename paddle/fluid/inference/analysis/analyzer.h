/*
 * This file contains Analyzer, an class that exposed as a library that analyze
 * and optimize Fluid ProgramDesc for inference. Similar to LLVM, it has
 * multiple flags to
 * control whether an process is applied on the program.
 *
 * The processes are called Passes in analysis, the Passes are placed in a
 * pipeline, the first Pass is the FluidToDataFlowGraphPass which transforms a
 * Fluid ProgramDesc to
 * a data flow graph, the last Pass is DataFlowGraphToFluidPass which transforms
 * a data flow graph to a Fluid ProgramDesc. The passes in the middle of the
 * pipeline can be any Passes
 * which take a node or data flow graph as input.
 *
 * The Analyzer can be used in two methods, the first is a executable file which
 * can be used to pre-process the inference model and can be controlled by
 * passing difference command flags;
 * the other way is to compose inside the inference API as a runtime pre-process
 * phase in the inference service.
