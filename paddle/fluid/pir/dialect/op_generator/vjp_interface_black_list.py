# VjpInterface gen op list
# =====================================
# we don't support vjp function code
# gen now, so we use a whitelist to
# control the generation of Vjp methods.
# TODO(wanghao107)
# remove this file and support Vjp methods
# code gen.

# Operators which only has composite implementation should be added below.
# For example
# * `silu_double_grad` only has composite implementation, so `silu_grad` was added below.
# * `log_double_grad` has both composite and kernel implementation, so `log_grad` should not be added below.

vjp_interface_black_list = [
    'silu_grad',
    'exp_grad',
    'abs_double_grad',
    'where_grad',
    'bmm_grad',
]
