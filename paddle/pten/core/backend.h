 * [ Why need Backend? ]

 * Backend not only means place. Backend is a superset of place.
 *
 * Place cannot indicate the difference in calculation methods on the device,
 * but in order to make the boundary of the kernel clearer and the function
 * more specific, we need to distinguish the calculation method.
 *
 * Such as the kernel for CUDA device, it is native CUDA kernel, or kernel
 * by calling CUDNN library.
