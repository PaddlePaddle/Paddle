 * [ Why need Backend? ]
 *
 * Backend not only means place. Backend is a superset of place.
 *
 * Place cannot indicate the difference in calculation methods on the device,
 * but in order to make the boundary of the kernel clearer and the function
 * more specific, we need to distinguish the calculation method.
 *
 * Such as the kernel for CPU device, it can be a native CPU kernel,
 * or a kernel implemented by MKLDNN library.
 *
 * Note(chenweihang): HIP is not needed now, we can added it if needed
 * in the future
